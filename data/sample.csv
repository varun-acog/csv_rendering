"In this paper, a robust 3D triangular mesh watermarking algorithm based on 3D segmentation is proposed. In this algorithm three classes of watermarking are combined. First, we segment the original image to many different regions. Then we mark every type of region with the corresponding algorithm based on their curvature value. The experiments show that our watermarking is robust against numerous attacks including RST transformations, smoothing, additive random noise, cropping, simplification and remeshing.","['S.

"We studied an autoassociative neural network with dynamic synapses which include a facilitating mechanism. We have developed a general mean-field framework to study the relevance of the different parameters defining the dynamics of the synapses and their influence on the collective properties of the network. Depending on these parameters, the network shows different types of behaviour including a retrieval phase, an oscillatory regime, and a non-retrieval phase. In the oscillatory phase, the network activity continously jumps between the stored patterns. Compared with other activity-dependent mechanisms such as synaptic depression, synaptic facilitation enhances the network ability to switch among the stored patterns and, therefore, its adaptation to external stimuli. A detailed analysis of our system reflects an efficient-more rapid and with lesser errors-network access to the stored information with stronger facilitation. We also present a set of Monte Carlo simulations confirming our analytical results.","['Joaquín J. Torres', 'Jesús M. Cortés', 'Joaquín Marro', 'Hilbert J.

"It is well-known that Sturmian sequences are the non ultimately periodic sequences that are balanced over a 2-letter alphabet. They are also characterized by their complexity: they have exactly $(n+1)$ distinct factors of length $n$. A natural generalization of Sturmian sequences is the set of infinite episturmian sequences. These sequences are not necessarily balanced over a $k$-letter alphabet, nor are they necessarily aperiodic. In this paper, we characterize balanced episturmian sequences, periodic or not, and prove Fraenkel's conjecture for the special case of episturmian sequences. It appears that balanced episturmian sequences are all ultimately periodic and they can be classified in 3 families.","['Genevi eve Paquin', 'Laurent Vuillon']",50,"['1c655ee2-067d-4bc4-b8cc-bc779e9a7f10', '2e4e57ca-d190-4bc7-b7ad-2e33aca2f574', '508ea83a-035b-4542-a315-9247c172d255', '666a65af-8657-43f6-b765-f2b72a16726a', '8100bfb7-3f6a-4269-bba8-7c4a6a578570', '8e035cc6-d692-4532-bb3c-a6a34b4db83a', 'e10a00d9-bb59-4f19-8f1c-85917bc03b5f']",A characterization of balanced episturmian sequences,Electronic Journal of Combinatorics,2007,4ab3a4cf-1d96-4ce5-ab6f-b3e19fc260de
"One of the fundamental challenges of recognizing actions is accounting for the variability that arises when arbitrary cameras capture humans performing actions. In this paper, we explicitly identify three important sources of variability: (1) viewpoint, (2) execution rate, and (3) anthropometry of actors, and propose a model of human actions that allows us to investigate all three. Our hypothesis is that the variability associated with the execution of an action can be closely approximated by a linear combination of action bases in joint spatio-temporal space. We demonstrate that such a model bounds the rank of a matrix of image measurements and that this bound can be used to achieve recognition of actions based only on imaged data. A test employing principal angles between subspaces that is robust to statistical fluctuations in measurement data is presented to find the membership of an instance of an action. The algorithm is applied to recognize several actions, and promising results have been obtained.","['Yaser Sheikh', 'Mumtaz Sheikh', 'Mubarak Shah']",221,"['056116c1-9e7a-4f9b-a918-44eb199e67d6', '05ac52a1-dfa2-4c32-9a54-6c1e58cfcca5', '0b2f71cc-6797-445a-82df-5be29945c0a7', '60cf9842-c3aa-463d-a5cf-17fbb8f99ccd', '7a3bb575-8313-4e77-a008-ee5cde444746', '7eda9b91-21f1-490f-8ef2-f94e81c558a4', '905461e4-643b-4da0-a669-f52318b9e126', 'be336575-9974-411d-b637-45440213cbd4', 'be9527aa-97e2-4951-86d1-cc6130cbb777', 'f0d57def-3340-49be-a1c3-cbc996af8dec']",Exploring the space of a human action,international conference on computer vision,2005,4ab3a98c-3620-47ec-b578-884ecf4a6206

"Queueing networks with multiple classes of customers play a fundamental role for evaluating the performance of both software and hardware architectures. The main strength of product–form models, in particular of BCMP queueing networks, is that they combine a flexible formalism with efficient analysis techniques and solution algorithms. In this paper we provide an algorithm that starting from a high–level description of a system, and from the definition of its components in terms of interacting sub–systems, computes a multiple–class and multiple–chain BCMP queueing network. We believe that the strength of this approach is twofold. First, the modeller deals with simplified models, which are defined in a modular and hierarchical way. Hence, we can carry on sensitivity analysis that may easily include structural changes (and not only on the time parameters). Second, maintaining the product–form property allows one to derive the average system performance indices very efficiently.

"A CMOS oscillator employing differential transistor pairs working in Class-C in push-pull configuration is presented. The oscillator exhibits the same advantages enjoyed by complementary topologies on oscillators based on a single differential pair, while yielding a substantial power consumption reduction thanks to the Class-C operation. The phase-noise performance and the fundamental conditions required to keep the transistors working in Class-C are analyzed in detail. It is shown that, for an optimal performance, both nMOS and pMOS transistors should not be pushed into the deep triode region by the instantaneous resonator voltage, and a simple circuit solution is proposed to accommodate a large oscillation swing. A 0.18- μm CMOS prototype of the (voltage-controlled) oscillator displays an oscillation frequency from 6.09 to 7.50 GHz. The phase noise at 2-MHz offset is below -120 dBc/Hz with a power dissipation of 2.2 mW, for a state-of-the-art figure-of-merit ranging from 189 to 191 dBc/Hz.","['Andrea Mazzanti', 'Pietro Andreani']",50,"['0a09db01-264a-4bdf-942c-d33cceb35d3c', '36c942df-7fcb-40b8-b023-a3a4001f632e', '84c00b06-a611-4082-89f7-df2d5540d210', 'a5496509-ebaf-472b-bc83-2e7c503e55bf', 'b8b564ca-0651-4fd4-8db0-0f7710e25ce1', 'bb1ed638-e3c3-46f7-adf9-6977afca564a', 'e3a35338-4747-46f7-b752-5690a5c3c84a', 'f277b0e7-3f23-4a22-ac17-fc6c6019c664']",A Push–Pull Class-C CMOS VCO,IEEE Journal of Solid-state Circuits,2013,4ab3f7cd-140b-4e29-99d4-f4e8006c4f65
"In statistical setting of the pattern recognition problem the number of examples required to approximate an unknown labelling function is linear in the VC dimension of the target learning class. In this work we consider the question whether such bounds exist if consider only computable pattern recognition methods, assuming that the unknown labelling function is also computable. We find that in this case the number of examples required for a computable method to approximate the labelling function not only is not linear, but grows faster (in the VC dimension of the class) than any computable function. No time or space constraints are put on the predictors or target functions; the only resource we consider is the training examples.#R##N##R##N#The task of pattern recognition is considered in conjunction with another learning problem — data compression.

"In 1999, Iwan Duursma defined the zeta function for a linear code as a generating function of its Hamming weight enumerator. It can also be defined for other homogeneous polynomials not corresponding to existing codes. If the homogeneous polynomial is invariant under the MacWilliams transform, then its zeta function satisfies a functional equation and we can formulate an analogue of the Riemann hypothesis. As far as existing codes are concerned, the Riemann hypothesis is believed to be closely related to the extremal property. In this article, we show there are abundant polynomials invariant by the MacWilliams transform which satisfy the Riemann hypothesis. The proof is carried out by explicit construction of such polynomials. To prove the Riemann hypothesis for a certain class of invariant polynomials, we establish an analogue of the Enestrom-Kakeya theorem.",['Koji Chinen'],0,"['02d38c7d-3baf-40e3-86d7-a8884ff503f4', '078e6ac3-f385-42e2-a966-5ca05b98588a', 'b06b90e7-36f4-418a-82b2-656645469cf6', 'b86d2872-8125-4909-957a-d1e0f9cacb90']",An abundance of invariant polynomials satisfying the Riemann hypothesis,Discrete Mathematics,2008,4ab459ce-5f18-4cc0-9627-1dc557eb8b68
"Entity Resolution (ER) is the problem of identifying which records in a database refer to the same real-world entity. An exhaustive ER process involves computing the similarities between pairs of records, which can be very expensive for large datasets. Various blocking techniques can be used to enhance the performance of ER by dividing the records into blocks in multiple ways and only comparing records within the same block. However, most blocking techniques process blocks separately and do not exploit the results of other blocks. In this paper, we propose an  iterative blocking framework  where the ER results of blocks are reflected to subsequently processed blocks. Blocks are now iteratively processed until no block contains any more matching records. Compared to simple blocking, iterative blocking may achieve higher accuracy because reflecting the ER results of blocks to other blocks may generate additional record matches. Iterative blocking may also be more efficient because processing a block now saves the processing time for other blocks. We implement a scalable iterative blocking system and demonstrate that iterative blocking can be more accurate and efficient than blocking for large datasets.","['Steven Euijong Whang', 'David Menestrina', 'Georgia Koutrika', 'Martin Theobald', 'Hector Garcia-Molina']",211,"['0b5e0bfa-12ff-4175-9d65-d8cc62552ae6', '2cba753f-24b1-4b6c-8d36-b9bf66bd1477', '33d18bee-c873-4cf5-8962-e79a032cbdf3', '3960350c-fc91-4fae-83f3-69899d9c8a6f', '5d57c4fa-8dda-4e92-b42b-67f8d16f8602', '717f3af1-aa86-41db-90e5-bfb94ecf8616', '71e35609-693a-4036-9bac-861a7ce7c868', '76c1da70-2949-47c3-aefa-9d703c884cd3', '78001688-d865-4fda-a2eb-d5097c93bbb9', '866e99e1-f1d4-4be9-be12-1f3fe444fc52', '8cf0f572-0507-48cf-9ada-37c152f5810f', '99ac2c24-4d9a-4a96-a9a7-4ada6393677e', '9ff322c1-64c8-49e5-9c23-4b380eff5f10', 'b123d7d1-cced-41cc-a8fc-c710a8f8a736', 'b22383b0-6528-4156-9069-472d895438c3', 'b55b3100-5054-4d25-860d-d3e32fc56d14', 'c9b221ed-7083-4ae7-835c-8e8bd5af22ec', 'fb565ef1-0650-4e55-b68a-1936d8ddb188']",Entity resolution with iterative blocking,international conference on management of data,2009,4ab46288-3a29-471f-95c9-9926df1f93ce
"Performance analysts profile their programs to find methods that are worth optimizing: the ""hot"" methods. This paper shows that four commonly-used Java profilers ( xprof , hprof , jprofile, and yourkit ) often disagree on the identity of the hot methods. If two profilers disagree, at least one must be incorrect. Thus, there is a good chance that a profiler will mislead a performance analyst into wasting time optimizing a cold method with little or no performance improvement.   This paper uses causality analysis to evaluate profilers and to gain insight into the source of their incorrectness. It shows that these profilers all violate a fundamental requirement for sampling based profilers: to be correct, a sampling-based profilermust collect samples randomly.   We show that a proof-of-concept profiler, which collects samples randomly, does not suffer from the above problems. Specifically, we show, using a number of case studies, that our profiler correctly identifies methods that are important to optimize; in some cases other profilers report that these methods are cold and thus not worth optimizing.","['Todd Mytkowicz', 'Amer Diwan', 'Matthias Hauswirth', 'Peter F.

Instead of extracting regions of interest for retargeting, the uninteresting parts are removed from the scene in Shai Avidan and Shamir, A. (2007). This is done by computing the RGB variance within non-overlapping 3times3 blocks and removing the block path with minimal variance cost using dynamic programming.

"Scalable storage architectures allow for the addition of disks to increase storage capacity and/or bandwidth. In its general form, disk scaling also refers to disk removals when either capacity needs to be conserved or old disk drives are retired. Assuming random placement of blocks on multiple nodes of a continuous media server, our optimization objective is to redistribute a minimum number of media blocks after disk scaling. This objective should be met under two restrictions. First, uniform distribution and hence a balanced load should be ensured after redistribution. Second, the redistributed blocks should be retrieved at the normal mode of operation in one disk access and through low complexity computation. We propose a technique that meets the objective, while we prove that it also satisfies both restrictions. The SCADDAR approach is based on using a series of REMAP functions which can derive the location of a new block using only its original location as a basis.","['Ashish Goel', 'Cyrus Shahabi', 'Shu-Yuen Didi Yao', 'Roger Zimmermann']",70,"['1d950f41-7ecc-4243-a2bc-e91242887637', '57868e44-9a01-488a-989f-fd18a57a790f', '60e1ce59-a6a3-49dc-9727-3c02d166188a', '72f144d2-8bfc-4eb1-ba37-8cf9ef190a52', '73c49f25-1710-42b9-bc25-e12c3d47f3de', '756dc97f-4124-4692-bf08-c227c4d6d58f', '9e0fc090-adfe-4482-a1a0-b7037922db10', 'a5385305-4572-443e-bcaa-1297e87aaabb', 'ad9ae838-b7be-4c54-9536-1ba11cf2ff92', 'befc800b-996e-4798-b300-303126ad8fd8', 'e3fc9188-4c99-404e-a22c-7ae7413f0238', 'fd8e4a2e-4e59-4c80-982f-d7ac6db3fe54']",SCADDAR: an efficient randomized technique to reorganize continuous media blocks,international conference on data engineering,2002,4ab50bd7-8e59-4974-a6d0-59a577dcc10d

"Freezing tolerance in plants is obtained during a period of low nonfreezing temperatures before the winter sets on, through a biological process known as cold acclimation. Cold is one of the major stress factors that limits the growth, productivity and distribution of plants, and understanding the mechanism of cold tolerance is therefore important for crop improvement. Expressed sequence tags (EST) analysis is a powerful, economical and time-efficient way of assembling information on the transcriptome. To date, several EST sets have been generated from cold-induced cDNA libraries from several different plant species. In this study we utilize the variation in the frequency of ESTs sampled from different cold-stressed plant libraries, in order to identify genes preferentially expressed in cold in comparison to a number of control sets. The species included in the comparative study are oat (Avena sativa), barley (Hordeum vulgare), wheat (Triticum aestivum), rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis thaliana. However, in order to get comparable gene expression estimates across multiple species and data sets, we choose to compare the expression of tentative ortholog groups (TOGs) instead of single genes, as in the normal procedure. We consider TOGs as preferentially expressed if they are detected as differentially expressed by a test statistic and up-regulated in comparison to all control sets, and/or uniquely expressed during cold stress, i.e., not present in any of the control sets. The result of this analysis revealed a diverse representation of genes in the different species. In addition, the derived TOGs mainly represent genes that are long-term highly or moderately expressed in response to cold and/or other stresses.","['Angelica Lindlöf', 'Marcus Bräutigam', 'Aakash Chawade', 'Björn Olsson', 'Olof Olsson']",0,"['9b8ad98f-1db8-4201-8246-cbc0812606d8', 'e5b94864-84e2-4833-9df5-6189c844654a']",Identification of cold-induced genes in cereal crops and arabidopsis through comparative analysis of multiple EST sets,bioinformatics research and development,2007,4ab54610-4947-46c7-bd56-fc672dfba5cc
"This position paper concerns itself with real-time safety critical distributed systems. It presents a computational model that is appropriate for this type of application and architecture. It then defines a resource allocations scheme based upon fixed priority scheduling. Such a scheme has the advantage (over purely static schedules) of supporting greater levels of flexibility and non-determinism, whilst still providing static guarantees of necessary timing behaviour (i.e. end-to-end deadlines through the systems). Priority based communication protocols are investigated, with possible future techniques reviewed.","['Alan Burns', 'Neil C. Audsley', 'Andy J.

"a b s t r a c t The constant pressure–temperature (P–T) flash plays an important role in the modelling of fluid-phase behaviour, and its solution is especially challenging for equations of state in which the volume is expressed as an implicit function of the pressure. We explore the relative merits of solving the P–T flash in two ensembles: mole numbers, pressure and temperature, in which each free-energy evaluation requires the use of a numerical solver; and mole numbers, volume and temperature, in which a direct evaluation of the free-energy is possible. We examine the performance of two algorithms, HELD (Helmholtz free energy Lagrangian dual), introduced in Pereira et al. (2012), and GILD (Gibbs free energy Lagrangian dual), introduced here, for the fluid-phase equilibria of 8 mixtures comprising up to 10 components, using two equations of state. While the reliability of both algorithms is comparable, the computational cost of HELD is consistently lower; this difference becomes increasingly pronounced as the number of components is increased. © 2014 The Authors.

"Virtual position-based routing protocols have many attractive characteristics for wireless sensor networks. Typically, such protocols use a proactive scheme for updating routing tables. Because sensor networks can have very low data rate, sending periodic beacons to update routing tables can be very expensive. Instead, reactive approaches might be more appropriate in such scenarios. MANET-inspired reactive routing protocols do not scale well because of the effort in the order of O(n) for each routing information update. In this paper, we present Reactive Virtual Cord Protocol (RVCP), a data-centric reactive virtual position based routing protocol for use in sensor networks. Route discovery is directed towards the destination and hence there is no need to flood the entire network to discover a route. Our approach is based on Virtual Cord Protocol (VCP), an efficient, virtual relative position based routing protocol that also provides support for data management as known from typical Distributed Hash Table (DHT) services. To minimize the end-to-end delay and energy consumption, we used adaptive techniques for the development of RVCP.","['Abdalkarim Awad', 'Andreas Mitschele-Thiel', 'Falko Dressler']",1,"['0d4d0363-07b5-43b6-976d-955e96044709', '29424b9c-c448-4679-8472-044e701a11ea', '2f4e35f1-6dca-46f6-8157-980564a94da0', '3382adea-17b5-4515-a0a7-043f78493e0e', '5bbcc50b-0f4b-4c51-8487-0630f8400f61', '60fb0dc2-bde3-4714-948e-de0ed12ab460', '6288f6da-12ac-4f71-b3dd-37fe580b6793', '6bb012bc-9e9e-4b8d-8098-9b972e612593', '7bd442a1-fb27-4e38-8635-d4c0367f3e2d', '7d42815c-daac-4c27-a9a3-39bd29536fed', '7f9d2a8a-12d1-4944-8c82-99eade0d7442', '8ee59530-fc2a-4b2f-92d0-c241e654f52c', 'ada4eba5-6923-4b92-bf17-9fd360a90b14', 'd381281a-14a0-4d73-993f-723a06096a09', 'e52fc0f5-b2e0-4ecc-a145-3e4e20178da8']",Reactive Virtual Position-Based Routing in Wireless Sensor Networks,international conference on computer communications and networks,2011,4ab5d145-0ea8-49b5-b517-93677e7cbe88

"In this paper, a weighting-delay-based method is developed for the study of the stability problem of a class of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with time-varying delay. Different from previous results, the delay interval [0, d(t)] is divided into some variable subintervals by employing weighting delays. Thus, new delay-dependent stability criteria for RNNs with time-varying delay are derived by applying this weighting-delay method, which are less conservative than previous results. The proposed stability criteria depend on the positions of weighting delays in the interval [0, d(t)], which can be denoted by the weighting-delay parameters. Different weighting-delay parameters lead to different stability margins for a given system. Thus, a solution based on optimization methods is further given to calculate the optimal weighting-delay parameters. Several examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed criteria.","['Huaguang Zhang', 'Zhenwei Liu', 'Guang-Bin Huang', 'Zhanshan Wang']",266,"['11560f85-2543-466f-b338-5ef10a073db7', '14feaffa-1566-44d0-b798-80c027655c1a', '2b258346-2416-4156-abcf-f8f3c3bc99c4', '36739ece-b2b9-4c95-8e96-e1135048101c', '38d20ba0-db8e-47db-ab6b-f2898683a0a1', '4b782405-24db-456f-a058-2b8fd79ea3db', '56d975c5-f372-4eee-8667-1cae480cb57c', '669f9f47-d6bf-462e-b2a6-8300ac07835b', '714a8cc0-486f-4259-bb81-66b5f248e016', '758bcb76-b6a4-415b-8403-1fcd1a8c5643', 'b5af1799-bc84-45f5-823c-193b846455d7', 'b6bbf822-292c-4dfa-a98b-d61b798446cc', 'b76d4f7b-2eac-4eae-8a9d-bd21123e4356', 'bee7d6d4-1d2f-4b8b-951e-466c8e67785b', 'd32e8c91-9c64-438b-bee6-2c89ddb2db0a', 'd8263bb4-5ecb-454a-96b0-fb9a84be03b9', 'dc0ffeb4-7087-4f36-b599-43bb8de95ad1', 'f40a5ee9-78d1-40c9-ae7f-bc4cfc143624', 'f93b2e01-ba5c-47c3-94f3-de9ac10991d9']",Novel Weighting-Delay-Based Stability Criteria for Recurrent Neural Networks With Time-Varying Delay,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks,2010,4ab5e3f4-9b58-4fbb-9bde-ee2f2185cc61
"Search for information is no longer exclusively limited within the native language of the user, but is more and more extended to other languages. This gives rise to the problem of cross-language information retrieval (CLIR), whose goal is to find relevant information written in a different language to a query. In addition to the problems of monolingual information retrieval (IR), translation is the key problem in CLIR: one should translate either the query or the documents from a language to another. However, this translation problem is not identical to full-text machine translation (MT): the goal is not to produce a human-readable translation, but a translation suitable for finding relevant documents. Specific translation methods are thus required. The goal of this book is to provide a comprehensive description of the specifi c problems arising in CLIR, the solutions proposed in this area, as well as the remaining problems. The book starts with a general description of the monolingual IR and CLIR problems. Different classes of approaches to translation are then presented: approaches using an MT system, dictionary-based translation and approaches based on parallel and comparable corpora. In addition, the typical retrieval effectiveness using different approaches is compared. It will be shown that translation approaches specifically designed for CLIR can rival and outperform high-quality MT systems. Finally, the book offers a look into the future that draws a strong parallel between query expansion in monolingual IR and query translation in CLIR, suggesting that many approaches developed in monolingual IR can be adapted to CLIR. The book can be used as an introduction to CLIR. Advanced readers can also find more technical details and discussions about the remaining research challenges in the future. It is suitable to new researchers who intend to carry out research on CLIR.",['Jian-Yun Nie'],108,"['05da32dc-92b9-49a6-86f0-54b6dfc51502', '0d2d8a21-065a-4f1f-a167-4eeb8222ca3c', '17137631-a0ab-48e6-8ffb-607ec171f5a5', '333a3435-4b92-4958-92c9-ec3ac586c063', '34d0159e-4244-474f-a9cf-758b0ebb5ecb', '41fc1b12-bc24-4259-b263-4792ca3572a7', '48bc5327-f3a0-4efc-860f-8ef399c43f77', '49945432-7716-4bbf-af7b-c164405548b3', '5443ee2f-a083-4829-bfd3-b92e50b6d78e', '56bdde8a-8fcf-46e0-a426-ce2d695d4e62', '6741ecf3-e230-44a8-9ad0-a2ca2804b93e', '7f2449b4-c535-4d5a-a322-56cc7cffd463', '808c6e5d-4f8a-4aae-9251-0daa41e97f81', '81e1e9ee-2fa2-42ff-8880-b3c66423f276', '81f773c9-9844-43b5-8a63-f9e1f6e1ace8', '88aac5cb-119b-4c92-8271-d94d51e18b90', '894abe0d-19ac-44cc-9e25-d8f4ce1ee44f', '8cfd8f8d-2580-47e6-8e97-7cb448f292a9', '934cae12-e8ed-4394-aad0-5b0148113804', '9bdbf6d6-db2b-4114-969a-37b4e03993b0', 'a26bb4d3-8093-47e5-b755-efed705c4bbd', 'a3b4fc64-334a-44ac-8485-f8d8ca866fe5', 'b535d6b7-ec76-45d1-a35b-38d38dcaa976', 'c388859a-bdcf-408c-ad63-3754a3b989da', 'cce3336d-27a2-4737-b4df-133d8db7dd71', 'eb306335-b866-47c2-a410-d6d2c177bafe', 'f450b6e2-3ae2-46f2-804a-42d4518d956d', 'f4be32eb-646b-4d3f-aec7-8dad39edb522', 'f8f0f0d6-30e6-4581-8f05-1f6204fd43b3']",Cross-Language Information Retrieval,Synthesis Lectures on Human Language Technologies,2010,4ab5e4bd-08e2-4007-825c-d34ce7cb231f

"The performance of a multihop wireless network is typically affected by the interference caused by transmissions in the same network. In a statistical fading environment, the interference effects become harder to predict. Information sources in a multihop wireless network can improve throughput and delay performance of data streams by implementing interference-aware packet injection mechanisms. Forcing packets to wait at the head of queues and coordinating packet injections among different sources enable effective control of copacket interference. In this paper, throughput and delay performance in interference-limited multihop networks is analyzed. Using nonlinear probabilistic hopping models, waiting times which jointly optimize throughput and delay performances are derived. Optimal coordinated injection strategies are also investigated as functions of the number of information sources and their separations. The resulting analysis demonstrates the interaction of performance constraints and achievable capacity in a wireless multihop network.","['Ahmed Bader', 'Eylem Ekici']",14,"['0005fd5c-a351-4527-8f92-c05785cbaa1a', '05bf2d5c-d02c-4fba-a284-6274613c4573', '072bf77e-8d9b-4325-9f75-ae52d23ecb2a', '2b837b12-4500-4d40-8b07-7dece11a2563', '54501e11-a547-41e7-bc2c-b1ed416a3960', '886d74c8-abc3-45c8-a7fa-39d492bba528', '8cc9ea80-563f-4e62-bda9-8ff6d71cf6ae', '8e76b153-4a9a-4fa1-b346-1dc3f47ad505', '8f597291-22a7-40f5-9ab5-587ce00bacc5', 'a301962a-6d47-4fcc-9a89-5c67e1fac20f', 'b4543ef2-2b22-4fd8-b9b2-8d75f66cd8b9', 'b5c2c141-a999-46fa-8b97-ef1863e206fc', 'f3977629-ce12-4503-95dd-f57929ca92c9', 'fe9a64a7-aa51-4435-82b7-64fb2a63ed6d']",Performance optimization of interference-limited multihop networks,IEEE\/ACM Transactions on Networking,2008,4ab62e1f-0ed3-42fc-bfd4-64d255150506
"We propose Action-Reaction Learning as an approach for analyzing and synthesizing human behaviour. This paradigm uncovers causal mappings between past and future events or between an action and its reaction by observing time sequences. We apply this method to analyze human interaction and to subsequently synthesize human behaviour. Using a time series of perceptual measurements, a system automatically discovers correlations between past gestures from one human participant (action) and a subsequent gesture (reaction) from another participant. A probabilistic model is trained from data of the human interaction using a novel estimation technique, Conditional Expectation Maximization (CEM). The estimation uses general bounding and maximization to monotonically find the maximum conditional likelihood solution. The learning system drives a graphical interactive character which probabilistically predicts a likely response to a user's behaviour and performs it interactively. Thus, after analyzing human interaction in a pair of participants, the system is able to replace one of them and interact with a single remaining user.","['Tony Jebara', 'Alex Pentland']",76,"['4d9393e3-9936-4bd4-8da2-8d3b0360ef93', '528f4f4d-7995-48ca-8e9a-83182d9d1c36', '56e5ed17-8b83-4493-898c-3282c07c4013', '57eadb55-c2fa-42e1-a0c4-9da5e1658ff9', '5c082884-b447-4c89-bdc7-7fd0c57c4c13', '62f26948-5305-49da-b0e6-c0206afb33dc', '838ef012-ce45-4921-b1eb-4f419462561a', '95c6635e-6828-468b-883a-d4f4723e5a9c', '99cd9eb6-70e8-4b6e-99db-79520995554c', 'c5b62464-c36b-49a5-ab53-563094b25c07']",Action Reaction Learning: Automatic Visual Analysis and Synthesis of Interactive Behaviour,international conference on computer vision systems,1999,4ab63381-d9bd-4be4-aa89-bb5cab20295e

In this paper, a score function is defined for splitting lower and upper band of two-band speech model and estimation method of band-splitting frequency which is the boundary of the two bands is proposed. The score function is calculated for each harmonic frequency using the normalized autocorrelation function of the time signal corresponding to the each sub-band divided by the given frequency. By using the score function, tracking technique is applied to the band-splitting frequency estimation procedure to reflect the continuity between neighboring frames. Experimental tests confirm that the proposed score function is effective for estimation of the band-splitting frequency and produces better results compared with the previous other methods.","['Eun-Kyoung Kim', 'Woo-Jin Han', 'Yung-Hwan Oh']",50,"['22477b53-262d-41f3-b670-82cccf7fa6ff', '351057d5-d592-4955-abbb-1a5ac4e7cc35', '6fc63d37-049d-4dea-a695-2b2e7f1a757e', 'c29548d1-afbe-4962-b6c9-0b6ea373ccea', 'c3eaeebf-e42d-41a6-b6bc-26bd2e216f7c', 'e6d75cd5-f580-4225-a323-ecfba2ee2753']",A score function of splitting band for two-band speech model,Speech Communication,2003,4ab668fa-93a0-4a1e-8078-86af8adc56f0

"The popularity of service oriented computing (SOC) brings a large number of distributed, well-encapsulated and reusable services all over Internet, and makes it possible to create value-added services by means of service composition. Current composition styles are too professional to those end users when building their own applications. Actually, the end user would prefer rapidly discovering the best-of-breed services to assemble as well as visually personalizing the presentation to enjoy rich experiences. We propose an end user service composition approach for reducing the composition complexity and difficulty from the end user perspective. In our approach, similar candidate services are aggregated together as a unified resource, whose wide QoS spectrum can be easily manipulated by the end users to satisfy their requirements. Then they can personalize the services and, the composition occurs only at the presentation layer. The main contributions of the approach are: (i) enabling the end users to personalize the composite application with more powerful presentation; (ii) supporting the end users to dynamically customize the service composition in terms of QoS; (iii) alleviating the end users from the time-consuming task of selecting service to compose.","['Xuanzhe Liu', 'Gang Huang', 'Hong Mei']",50,"['7dd6c17e-35df-40cf-a140-93f6f252a90d', '9efd4b54-f332-4c6e-b7da-bf10b7c6fbc8', 'd84e03fe-77f4-478f-a434-82715a95d17e', 'ed872f46-9eb7-4259-ac91-8341fcea321b', 'fa24a4b0-abaa-4610-90e5-0fec51446261']",Towards End User Service Composition,computer software and applications conference,2007,4ab69e2a-f00d-4f2b-843b-349918b7aceb
"article i nfo Computing phase-locking values between EEG signals is a popular method for quantifying functional connectivity. However, this method involves large-scale, high-resolution datasets, which impose a serious multiple testing problem. Standard multiple testing methods fail to exploit the information from the complex dependence structure that varies across hypotheses in spectral, temporal, and spatial dimensions and result in a severe loss of power. They tend to control the false positives at the cost of hiding true positives. We introduce a new approach, called optimal discovery procedure (ODP) for identifying synchrony that is statistically significant. ODP maximizes the number of true positives for a given number of false positives, and thus offers a theoretical optimum for detecting significant synchrony in a multiple testing situation. We demonstrate the utility of this method with PLV data obtained from a visual search study. We also present simulation analysis to confirm the validity and relevance of using ODP in comparison with the standard FDR method for given configurations of true synchrony. We also compare the effectiveness of ODP with our previously published investigation of hierarchical FDR method (Singh and Phillips, 2010).","['Archana K.

"Although microRNAs (miRNAs), other non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) (e.g. lncRNAs, pseudogenes and circRNAs) and competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) have been implicated in cell-fate determination and in various human diseases, surprisingly little is known about the regulatory interaction networks among the multiple classes of RNAs. In this study, we developed starBase v2.0 (http://starbase.sysu. edu.cn/) to systematically identify the RNA–RNA and protein–RNA interaction networks from 108 CLIP-Seq (PAR-CLIP, HITS-CLIP, iCLIP, CLASH) data sets generated by 37 independent studies. By analyzing millions of RNA-binding protein binding sites, we identified � 9000 miRNA-circRNA, 16 000 miRNApseudogene and 285 000 protein–RNA regulatory relationships. Moreover, starBase v2.0 has been updated to provide the most comprehensive CLIP-Seq experimentally supported miRNA-mRNA and miRNAlncRNA interaction networks to date. We identified � 10 000 ceRNA pairs from CLIP-supported miRNA target sites. By combining 13 functional genomic annotations, we developed miRFunction and ceRNAFunction web servers to predict the function of miRNAs and other ncRNAs from the miRNAmediated regulatory networks.

"For OFDM systems in fast fading, it is difficult to obtain a closed form expression for the OFDM symbol error probability. Thus, tight analytical bounds on actual performance are extremely useful for performance prediction and verification. Additionally, the structure of the bound provides insight into system behavior. A new expurgated 2-dimensional union bound is proposed and applied to an OFDM system in fast fading. This bound becomes extremely tight as the rate of fading L increases. Performance comparison of the new bound to a lower bound on a known expurgated union bound demonstrates a gain of up to 1.5 dB at P(e) = 10 2 for channel implicit diversity order of L = 4. A new simulated upper bound that uses a reduced state vector in a modified trellis search algorithm and a simulated lower bound that assumes limited knowledge of the ICI are also presented. Both bounds are derived from a ""time-varying"" finite state machine model of the received signal. Performance results for these bounds are extremely tight for small to large values of N, where N is the number of OFDM signal tones.

As the centerlines are not straight lines, the cross-sections are not parallel and well-known algorithms for surface tiling from parallel cross-sections cannot be used. Nonparallel cross-sections can be tiled by means of the maximal-disc interpolation method; special methods for branching-structures modeling by means of convolution surfaces produce excellent results, but these methods are more complex than our approach. The proposed method tiles nonparallel circular cross-sections and constructs a topologically-correct surface mesh. The method is not artifact-free, but it is fast and simple.

In this paper, we describe an efficient algorithm for finding disjoint paths between one source node and at most m+k target nodes in a metacube MC(k, m) excluding MC(*,1), MC(2,2), MC(3,2) and MC(3,3). We show that we can find m+k disjoint paths between the source node and the m+k targets of length at most metacube diameter plus (k+4) with time complexity of order of metacube degree times its diameter.","['Antoine Bossard', 'Keiichi Kaneko', 'Shietung Peng']",8,"['07539333-be5e-40e8-b115-bec00ad6d9ce', '145419d0-3a4b-448f-a7d7-f07a92e9a7e3', '4bdd5a77-cf78-41cc-8051-fe62543e3b7c', '51dc312c-c389-4fac-971b-dab755effd04', '598e54c9-096b-4ef7-b0de-3ed4914cf184', '59d01413-86a1-4aac-b90d-e7295c6ac35c', '742d4530-8a15-456f-9846-18c6baf3fedf', 'd52e80e7-fb5e-41eb-a3a1-18b9bf172275', 'e5f65765-0a90-4d08-9f68-3bbbc8c53368']",Node-to-Set Disjoint-path Routing in Metacube,parallel and distributed computing: applications and technologies,2009,4ab6eaa4-0b44-489d-90c5-790db4c9060e
"Current views of the control of complex, purposeful movements acknowledge that organizational processes must reconcile multiple concerns. The central priority is of course accomplishing the actor’s goal. But in specifying the manner in which this occurs, the action plan must accommodate such factors as the interaction of mechanical forces associated with the motion of a multilinked system (classical mechanics) and, in many cases, intrinsic bias toward preferred movement patterns, characterized by so-called “coordination dynamics.” The most familiar example of the latter is the symmetry constraint, where spatial trajectories and/or temporal landmarks (e.g., reversal points) of concurrentlymoving body segments (limbs, digits, etc.) exhibit mutual attraction. The natural coordination tendencies that emerge through these constraints can facilitate or hinder motor control, depending on the degree of congruency with the desired movement pattern. Motor control theorists have long recognized the role of classical mechanics in theories of movement organization, but an appreciation of the importance of intrinsic interlimb bias has been gained only recently. Although detailed descriptions of temporal coordination dynamics have been provided, systematic attempts to identify additional salient dimensions of interlimb constraint have been lacking. We develop and implement here a novel method for examining this problem by exploiting two robust principles of psychomotor behavior, the symmetry constraint and the Two-Thirds Power Law. Empirical evidence is provided that the relative spatial patterns of concurrently moving limbs are naturally constrained in much the same manner as previously identified temporal constraints and, further, that apparent velocity interference is an indirect, secondary consequence of primary spatial assimilation. The theoretical implications of spatial interference are elaborated with respect to movement organization and motor learning. The need to carefully consider the appropriate dimensions with which to characterize coordination dynamics is also discussed. © 2001 Cognitive Science","['Charles B. Walter', 'Stephan P.

"The availability of a model to measure the performance of evolutionary algorithms is very important, especially when these algorithms are applied to solve problems with high computational requirements. That model would compute an index of the quality of the solution reached by the algorithm as a function of run-time. Conversely, if we fix an index of quality for the solution, the model would give the number of iterations to be expected. In this work, we develop a statistical model to describe the performance of PBIL and CHC evolutionary algorithms applied to solve the root identification problem. This problem is basic in constraint-based, geometric parametric modeling, as an instance of general constraint-satisfaction problems. The performance model is empirically validated over a benchmark with very large search spaces.","['E. Yeguas', 'Robert Joan-Arinyo', 'M. V.

"In this paper we present a probabilistic calculus for formally modeling and reasoning about Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) with unreliable connections and mobility of nodes. In our calculus, a MANET node can locally broadcast messages to a group of nodes within its physical transmission range. The group probability is also introduced since two distinct nodes within different groups should receive messages from the same sender with different possibilities. Our calculus naturally captures essential features of MANETs, i.e., local broadcast, mobility and probability. Moreover, we give a formal operational semantics of the calculus in terms of the labeled transition system and define the notion of open bisimulation. Finally, we illustrate our calculus with a toy example.","['Si Liu', 'Yongxin Zhao', 'Huibiao Zhu', 'Qin Li']",3,"['29b15320-3963-4548-8c97-7489949ed089', '362a03d8-55d9-4f60-90ac-d5e3280efd16', '56647d93-fa06-4218-9bb1-ec2feed125c3', '6d974303-0b90-46f8-82ba-4911d135da1e', '6f647cb8-fc9c-4507-8c51-ec1feb70b5e9', '776c609f-eb2a-44f1-bff9-a9fc69b91b9d', '9979a23d-3394-4c52-8582-0072b4b6e6d9']",Towards a Probabilistic Calculus for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks,theoretical aspects of software engineering,2011,4ab717e9-32e7-4647-9e51-81b66414a761

"A semiblind method is proposed for simultaneously estimating the carrier frequency offsets (CFOs) and channels of an uplink multiuser multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) system. By incorporating the CFOs into the transmitted symbols and channels, the MIMO-OFDM with CFO is remodeled into an MIMO-OFDM without CFO. The known blind method for channel estimation (Zeng and Ng in 2004) (Y. H. Zeng and T. S. Ng, ldquoA semi-blind channel estimation method for multi-user multi-antenna OFDM systems,rdquo IEEE Trans. Signal Process., vol. 52, no. 5, pp. 1419-1429, May 2004.) is then directly used for the remodeled system to obtain the shaped channels with an ambiguity matrix. A pilot OFDM block for each user is then exploited to resolve the CFOs and the ambiguity matrix. Two dedicated pilot designs, periodical and consecutive pilots, are discussed. Based on each pilot design and the estimated shaped channels, two methods are proposed to estimate the CFOs. As a result, based on the second-order statistics (SOS) of the received signal and one pilot OFDM block, the CFOs and channels are found simultaneously. Finally, a fast equalization method is given to recover the signals corrupted by the CFOs.","['Yonghong Zeng', 'Abdul Rahim Leyman', 'Tung-Sang Ng']",50,"['0b9c7b31-9a00-448a-897e-8b1fec6b4016', '13051746-a7cf-4c0b-8853-7e8d3b591aac', '1dc8d7b8-cd52-4e4e-98fd-6f07aae169da', '1e1557e2-9648-457f-9eb9-d1a875d3b97a', '26916931-25c5-4ede-a21c-d50dee62153f', '442b4a58-1d22-4f63-8f07-d7d38d4013e9', '4d5e6dac-fca0-4d63-a700-b0e2d592b204', '50fbef46-1b72-4e0c-b330-cf7b5c2043be', '5294ba9d-7d58-441b-9d7e-2cf62c180df4', '540add15-c089-4dc3-aba0-8e84260ff115', '5fe100d5-0a35-4cbd-9370-c765969f432a', '6600dd62-3848-45b2-afdf-ed5c36b95f31', '67363078-a977-4960-b409-67240ec81161', '7c404115-67de-4391-b2ce-4f96fccca185', 'aa6c34aa-4a2c-47b5-bd7e-39581ee26d84', 'd3c063da-1971-42d9-a8c8-c848b4f1aef9', 'da76a005-ad94-4711-a2ec-69cc936cc7bf', 'ec185fee-a1f0-45a8-bf50-97691591373b', 'ede3111c-69bf-48cc-b0cd-c612d53e0c4b', 'ffabadcc-eb3d-4833-9f44-90d05b77af6c']",Joint Semiblind Frequency Offset and Channel Estimation for Multiuser MIMO–OFDM Uplink,IEEE Transactions on Communications,2007,4ab7247f-7956-47b4-b0e0-67a60907c248

"This paper computes and analyzes the natural compliance of fixturing and grasping arrangements. Traditionally, linear-spring contact models have been used to determine the natural compliance of multiple contact arrangements. However, these models are not supported by experiments or elasticity theory. We derive a closed-form formula for the stiffness matrix of multiple contact arrangements that admits a variety of nonlinear contact models, including the well-justified Hertz model. The stiffness matrix formula depends on the geometrical and material properties of the contacting bodies and on the initial loading at the contacts. We use the formula to analyze the relative influence of first- and second-order geometrical effects on the stability of multiple contact arrangements. Second-order effects, i.e., curvature effects, are often practically beneficial and sometimes lead to significant grasp stabilization. However, in some contact arrangements, curvature has a dominant destabilizing influence. Such contact arrangements are deemed stable under an all-rigid body model but, in fact, are unstable when the natural compliance of the contacting bodies is taken into account. We also consider the combined influence of curvature and contact preloading on stability. Contrary to conventional wisdom, under certain curvature conditions, higher preloading can increase rather than decrease grasp stability.

"Motivation: For establishing prognostic predictors of various diseases using DNA microarray analysis technology, it is desired to find selectively significant genes for constructing the prognostic model and it is also necessary to eliminate non-specific genes or genes with error before constructing the model.#R##N##R##N#Results: We applied projective adaptive resonance theory (PART) to gene screening for DNA microarray data. Genes selected by PART were subjected to our FNN-SWEEP modeling method for the construction of a cancer class prediction model. The model performance was evaluated through comparison with a conventional screening signal-to-noise (S2N) method or nearest shrunken centroids (NSC) method. The FNN-SWEEP predictor with PART screening could discriminate classes of acute leukemia in blinded data with 97.1% accuracy and classes of lung cancer with 90.0% accuracy, while the predictor with S2N was only 85.3 and 70.0% or the predictor with NSC was 88.2 and 90.0%, respectively.

"Two-operand binary addition is the most widely used arithmetic operation in modern datapath designs. To improve the efficiency of this operation, it is desirable to use an adder with good performance and area tradeoff characteristics. This paper presents an efficient carry-lookahead adder architecture based on the parallel-prefix computation graph. In our proposed method, we define the notion of triple-carry-operator, which computes the generate and propagate signals for a merged block which combines three adjacent blocks. We use this in conjunction with the classic approach of the carry-operator to compute the generate and propagate signals for a merged block combining two adjacent blocks. The timing-driven nature of the proposed design reduces the depth of the adder. In addition, we use a ripple-carry type of structure in the nontiming critical portion of the parallel-prefix computation network. These techniques help produce a good timing-area tradeoff characteristic. The experimental results indicate that our proposed adder is significantly faster than the popular Brent-Kung adder with some area overhead. On the adder hand, the proposed adder also shows marginally faster performance than the fast Kogge-Stone adder with significant area savings.","['S. Das', 'Sunil P.

"An intelligent control stand-alone doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) system using proportional-integral-derivative neural network (PIDNN) is proposed in this study. This system can be applied as a stand-alone power supply system or as the emergency power system when the electricity grid fails for all sub-synchronous, synchronous and super-synchronous conditions. The rotor side converter is controlled using the field-oriented control to produce three-phase stator voltages with constant magnitude and frequency at different rotor speeds. Moreover, the stator side converter, which is also controlled using field-oriented control, is primarily implemented to maintain the magnitude of the DC-link voltage. Furthermore, the intelligent PIDNN controller is proposed for both the rotor and stator side converters to improve the transient and steady-state responses of the DFIG system for different operating conditions. Both the network structure and on-line learning algorithm are introduced in detail. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed control scheme is verified through experimentation.","['Faa-Jeng Lin', 'Jonq-Chin Hwang', 'Kuang-Hsiung Tan', 'Zong-Han Lu', 'Yung-Ruei Chang']",5,"['1297ec68-9763-44a9-b60e-880ee359cb43', '5863265c-8808-433b-8335-b833c7906d42', '65033205-8fd6-4992-aa02-ef948364d06e', '72c969e4-2002-450f-9fa2-3af233f0e4f9', '88d5ab29-899f-4251-a766-218459fb3a33', '94bc995a-f5ba-48d3-a85c-6a0e6ff4dc68', 'a1044362-e073-47f7-936c-c6d9040db46e', 'a643d397-25b4-4002-8f6b-92b3ea83d508', 'a83f737b-160d-414f-93a0-1cc57b00d410', 'b2c8fd9d-be83-4570-8475-7df33f169978', 'd1a2ab37-610e-498e-9da8-263ec5a464e3', 'efaf7e17-6b68-4f9f-8550-0ee758578ede', 'f5010b13-da80-4406-8966-0ac0464d8fde', 'f932d94a-6da0-45ec-9638-180255f14760', 'f966c2a0-2956-4dd9-9efd-5166e71dea42']",Control of Doubly-Fed Induction Generator System Using PIDNNs,international conference on machine learning and applications,2010,4ab7fd62-8f72-4845-a1fb-77e2d9c2a733

"We present a new method for segmenting actions into primitives and classifying them into a hierarchy of action classes. Our scheme learns action classes in an unsupervised manner using examples recorded by multiple cameras. Segmentation and clustering of action classes is based on a recently proposed motion descriptor which can be extracted efficiently from reconstructed volume sequences. Because our representation is independent of viewpoint, it results in segmentation and classification methods which are surprisingly efficient and robust. Our new method can be used as the first step in a semi-supervised action recognition system that will automatically break down training examples of people performing sequences of actions into primitive actions that can be discriminatingly classified and assembled into high-level recognizers.","['Daniel Weinland', 'Rémi Ronfard', 'Edmond Boyer']",81,"['34e8e262-7d14-4476-862c-e4d63cc89847', '606cf3f6-c684-4aeb-89c5-ca5a80aac35a', '6bce238c-31af-4a32-b946-33ea41106c39', '7559d44c-9be7-4006-8151-c005fb6d2d81', '7709c157-24a2-4c1e-a71e-80e41870fb9c', '9ed5fa2c-555f-43c4-a0d6-6a17720ce6c0', '9f685db8-0510-479d-84fb-9855e59088d0', 'b44cb43a-420b-4001-a264-dd9a2f800bd9', 'bea599f9-f381-4047-95cb-a36f4ee6833f', 'dc530f5b-3d53-4a76-b344-d17d8ebb6dba', 'ea0481c6-5a8d-40ea-b0d4-a25469d4cd07', 'f05c8f6c-b49c-4a9f-8655-eac2dca6f1f4', 'f164fda9-7217-498f-ac19-0c44344d8ef5']",Automatic Discovery of Action Taxonomies from Multiple Views,computer vision and pattern recognition,2006,4ab82bb2-7785-4832-b3eb-a38471b58d07
"Viral integration plays an important role in the development of malignant diseases. Viruses differ in preferred integration site and flanking sequence. Viral integration sites (VIS) have been found next to oncogenes and common fragile sites. Understanding the typical DNA features near VIS is useful for the identification of potential oncogenes, prediction of malignant disease development and assessing the probability of malignant transformation in gene therapy. Therefore, we have built a database of human disease-related VIS (Dr.VIS, http://www.scbit.org/dbmi/drvis) to collect and maintain human disease-related VIS data, including characteristics of the malignant disease, chromosome region, genomic position and viral–host junction sequence.

"In competitive domains, the knowledge about the opponent can give players a clear advantage. This idea lead us in the past to propose an approach to acquire models of opponents, based only on the observation of their input-output behavior. If opponent outputs could be accessed directly, a model can be constructed by feeding a machine learning method with traces of the opponent. However, that is not the case in the Robocup domain. To overcome this problem, in this paper we present a three phases approach to model low-level behavior of individual opponent agents. First, we build a classifier to label opponent actions based on observation. Second, our agent observes an opponent and labels its actions using the previous classifier. From these observations, a model is constructed to predict the opponent actions. Finally, the agent uses the model to anticipate opponent reactions. In this paper, we have presented a proof-of-principle of our approach, termed OMBO (Opponent Modeling Based on Observation), so that a striker agent can anticipate a goalie.

"Free-viewpoint television is expected to create a more natural and interactive viewing experience by providing the ability to interactively change the viewpoint to enjoy a 3D scene. To render new virtual viewpoints, free-viewpoint systems rely on view synthesis. However, it is known that most objective metrics fail at predicting perceived quality of synthesized views. Therefore, it is legitimate to question the reliability of commonly used objective metrics to assess the quality of free-viewpoint video (FVV) sequences. In this paper, we analyze the performance of several commonly used objective quality metrics on FVV sequences, which were synthesized from decompressed depth data, using subjective scores as ground truth. Statistical analyses showed that commonly used metrics were not reliable predictors of perceived image quality when different contents and distortions were considered. However, the correlation improved when considering individual conditions, which indicates that the artifacts produced by some view synthesis algorithms might not be correctly handled by current metrics.","['Philippe Hanhart', 'Emilie Bosc', 'Patrick Le Callet', 'Touradj Ebrahimi']",9,"['0474a691-7445-41a6-b49e-a7d02c2ffd85', '15988225-11b3-461b-b564-21d6176f4389', '4426906c-7bb7-4aa6-b92b-3a76583c1c30', '670dcd9f-ed82-47a1-b8d3-82f4b30c1350', '7f1214b2-e070-4ff2-a5d3-647e7c16c2d7', '9dd77a8e-e857-4d71-858f-ef38e37393f1', 'a02408ac-4722-4491-bc1b-07d5b0f48e82', 'ba691df3-7d0b-4100-9295-9be852935267', 'ce5ef48f-a779-4c70-8e3f-959a894e987f', 'dab8aeb1-8ad8-4851-a2bd-d991db47e900', 'e9fea480-0342-4fee-8aae-1613267c6cd6']",Free-Viewpoint Video Sequences: a New Challenge for Objective Quality Metrics,multimedia signal processing,2014,4ab891e5-7bd7-40ba-ac54-3dcf0642e75d
"Writing code that talks to hardware is a crucial part of any embedded project. Both productivity and quality are needed, but some flaws in the traditional development process make these requirements difficult to meet.  We have recently introduced a new approach of dealing with hardware, based on the Devil language. Devil allows to write a high-level, formal definition of the programming interface of a peripheral circuit. A compiler automatically checks the consistency of a Devil specification, from which it generates the low-level, hardware-operating code.  In our original framework, the generated code is dependent of the host architecture (CPU, buses, and bridges). Consequently, any variation in the hardware environment requires a specific tuning of the compiler. Considering the variability of embedded architectures, this is a serious drawback. In addition, this prevents from mixing different buses in the same circuit interface.  In this paper, we remove those limitations by improving our framework in two ways. (i) We propose a better isolation between the Devil compiler and the host architecture. (ii) We introduce Trident, a language extension aimed at mapping one or several buses to each peripheral circuit.","['Fabrice Mérillion', 'Gilles Muller']",50,"['0b2a6255-a0cb-44b6-8ecb-882d6a448ddd', '3af98c71-e125-4f05-badf-ab617e2d8b0a', '4019be5b-c5f2-49dc-9780-98402c666f4d', 'a452b1cd-6a4b-4da0-b520-976e285c5520']",Dealing with Hardware in Embedded Software: A General Framework Based on the Devil Language,"languages, compilers, and tools for embedded systems",2001,4ab89589-b41d-41fb-8265-bb950011695c

"In this paper, we present a feedback implosion suppression (FIS) algorithm that reduces the volume of feedback information transmitted through the network without relying on any collaboration between users, or on any infrastructure other than the satellite network. Next generation satellite systems that utilize the Ka frequency band are likely to rely on various fade mitigation techniques, in order to guarantee a service quality that is comparable to other broadband technologies. User feedback would be a valuable input for a number of such components, however, collecting periodic feedback from a large number of users would result in the well-known feedback implosion problem. Feedback implosion is identified as a major problem when a large number of users try to transmit their feedback messages through the network, holding up a significant portion of the uplink resources and clogging the shared uplink medium. In this paper, we look at a system where uplink channel access is organized in time-slots. The goal of the FIS algorithm is to reduce the number of uplink time-slots hold up for the purpose of feedback transmission. Our analysis show that the FIS algorithm effectively suppresses the feedback messages of 95% of all active users, but still achieves acceptable performance results when the ratio of available time-slots to number of users is equal to or higher than 5%","['Gun Akkor', 'John S.

"Random geometric graphs (RGG) contain vertices whose points are uniformly distributed in a given plane and an edge between two distinct nodes exists when their distance is less than a given positive value. RGGs are appropriate for modeling ad hoc networks consisting of n mobile devices that are independently and uniformly distributed randomly in an area. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first paradigm to compute the subgraph probability of RGGs in a systematical way. In contrast to previous asymptotic bounds or approximation, which always assume that the number of nodes in the network tends to infinity, the closed-form formulas we derived herein are fairly accurate and of practical value. Moreover, computing exact subgraph probability in RGGs is shown to be a useful tool for counting the number of induced subgraphs, which explores fairly accurate quantitative property on topology of ad hoc networks.",['Chang Wu Yu'],5,"['07dbc8df-6347-4dc5-a9ae-a4d8ab334fc2', '09b8b840-7c8c-4aaf-9756-200354d1a125', '0b42aed7-4b33-499a-811e-5a85a45f48fb', '0c3aa16c-7eb8-4c5d-a693-fc31e3370c39', '14b569bb-cf5d-4f06-9bbe-a2f97a6c42cb', '1b0eabc4-68ee-432f-9d60-bee2ac2d4af7', '2cb634d9-7367-471e-9553-4f70279db30c', '315277c8-92d8-47e0-b3ce-767b5d94337f', '3236c00b-3ebe-4906-9753-101621e12389', '3972f766-3df3-4117-a302-a9a50349373f', '5e009ebc-78be-4d75-93da-b865debf2385', '6177aa78-da80-4f40-99b7-f132e07727cf', '6a7ce1b5-fcee-4a2a-8bc0-5ce9dbf09fcc', '6cceddf5-a9da-4383-879b-6d260f4faae7', '801e8a45-e3f1-4a83-aebc-881138683e78', '8f6b5d9c-b86d-4bd1-92de-789fbaa37027', '9c0bea1b-954a-4523-af28-0b56ed7a7aed', 'cbb0b85f-c11c-40d7-bf79-6b4b15f38f89', 'd81820fc-5dec-41ae-912f-9309dd9f45db', 'f2b582bb-2882-40ac-ad9c-d29f3cdae3de']",Computing subgraph probability of random geometric graphs with applications in quantitative analysis of ad hoc networks,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,2009,4ab924c6-2ae5-4456-a7a6-a7349187a7d4

"In this paper, we propose a content-aware retry limit adaptation scheme for video streaming over IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs (WLANs). Video packets of different importance are unequally protected with different retry limits at the MAC layer. The loss impact of each packet is estimated to guide the selection of its retry limit. More retry numbers are allocated to packets of higher loss impact to achieve unequal error protection. Experimental results show that the proposed adaptation scheme can effectively mitigate the error propagation due to packet loss and assure the on-time arrival of packets for presentation, thereby improving video quality significantly.","['Chih-Ming Chen', 'Chia-Wen Lin', 'Yung-Chang Chen']",50,"['6b1b6658-5e5c-4e6a-8254-57c8d00fd4bd', '8bbf641d-b6a2-4d85-a715-e36cec813df9', '9b8c22ef-d8f8-4e04-b911-410120125826']",Unequal Error Protection for Video Streaming Over Wireless LANs using Content-Aware Packet Retry Limit,international conference on multimedia and expo,2006,4ab944df-bc19-49e5-90e0-34bf9083a4a8
"Background#R##N#Recovering the structure of ancestral genomes can be formalized in terms of properties of binary matrices such as the Consecutive-Ones Property (C1P). The Linearization Problem asks to extract, from a given binary matrix, a maximum weight subset of rows that satisfies such a property. This problem is in general intractable, and in particular if the ancestral genome is expected to contain only linear chromosomes or a unique circular chromosome. In the present work, we consider a relaxation of this problem, which allows ancestral genomes that can contain several chromosomes, each either linear or circular.","['Ján Maňuch', 'Murray Patterson', 'Roland Wittler', 'Cedric Chauve', 'Eric Tannier']",27,"['17d10d56-7e5a-40fd-9e53-16aa91b13313', '2726e293-9509-487a-a223-736d0e7ce8eb', '3b28993e-6296-4574-8713-961e0f9ea6b4', '3de2a597-07e3-4ea2-bfd7-a50e0b08b108', '7223f858-05dd-429f-9356-2bce4e35fbd7', '75acd9ed-813f-4a26-89ef-f026be2cdeb2', '76ac822a-2760-4f08-8a95-5279c6e4d9b5', '79f4763e-2e56-486b-bc6b-aa442c0de9a6', '7ad1d77c-449c-4e15-8ee7-8d3a228b1ac9', '8d77026f-2f9b-4060-bc28-8375d99c221c', 'ab0e4d71-7054-4354-ab1e-b4307653cf1b', 'b2b3bcda-afd5-4037-9b50-3f56d0fa630a', 'b4592920-2c24-4486-857a-7b827000bca5', 'bdcef3ed-f124-4365-9e5d-b5189c15e39f', 'c5b57efd-96d2-4ea1-b696-42e37d91f0ed', 'e880c683-5a8d-47b8-8218-c3741032c5b6', 'e89344e0-a0af-46e8-9604-6f1c8235efbe', 'ebf009ba-176e-4bfa-a4f9-206d40898693', 'f5ed82c7-d512-470c-806c-eb10601f5fc9', 'f65f2813-3373-443d-89b9-2d0c612d5a68', 'fa15b915-8c6c-4425-ba7c-39f16d2235f4']",Linearization of ancestral multichromosomal genomes.,BMC Bioinformatics,2012,4ab959b8-6518-472b-9f57-62ce659147eb
"Today's computationally able mobile devices are capable of acting as service providers as opposed to their traditional role as consumers. To address the challenges associated with the development of these mobile services, we have developed Odin, a middleware which masks complexity, allowing rapid development of mobile services. Odin, however, does not allow cross-platform development, which is an important concern with today's wide variety of mobile devices. To solve this problem, we have designed Odin Tools - a model-driven toolkit for cross-platform development of mobile services. Leveraging appropriate metamodels, a prototype has been implemented in Eclipse and Marama that allows developers to model mobile services in a platform-independent manner. We are currently working on transformations between levels of the model hierarchy which will allow full Odin-based service implementations to be generated automatically.","['Andrew Meads', 'Ian Warren']",50,"['0bea1473-e2f8-4e71-9595-6c89546a7566', '151cd8e5-7843-464e-8a7d-c4e24d389a49', '24e27f74-105f-4962-bafd-18213900b53d', '49bb9b70-40a5-4ad3-bdfb-bcb9bc6356bb', '56a8b77b-31f2-4b91-8cba-5b5620a11007', '60979992-0dd4-487d-80f4-b9318662b8d8', '74c7dee1-9c82-4956-b3a2-c6ff992fa4fc', '9281b37f-0fcc-4c9f-8569-b6cca2306514', '93cb9069-4644-4291-a77d-6cdf1ed9ada9', '95220f17-d29c-49ee-b556-96ca8624fc0b', '9f152998-e255-474c-aaf6-642eeaa548bb', 'a3fb05c9-0687-4582-95a2-ec2bbc572bf8', 'a56cefbb-fa02-4049-bad8-fef30f926d20', 'bc31f45a-2d7e-4f1e-8a13-8f12dfd74209', 'e8b25286-46d2-40d9-ba7a-a170f83711ce', 'f05e8be4-07f2-45d5-a46e-578555a9ff2e', 'fbd2ffd8-0839-4842-804f-2ff6c1276377']",OdinTools--Model-Driven Development of Intelligent Mobile Services,,2011,4ab9608a-d7ea-43a4-a764-0293b9f179ea
"In recent years many studies have been published on the assessment of payoffs from investments in IT. The research has produced mainly mixed results. Different explanations can be given for these mixed results. One possible explanation might be the dominance of the rational perspective in previous research. The consequence of this overemphasis on rationality is that the social political nature of the IT investment process has largely been neglected in previous research on IT business value. This omission produces an incomplete picture and might contribute to the conflicting empirical results. In this research we studied whether and how the socio political perspective can be used to explain the mixed results. Case study research was used to test whether the attitude towards the value of IT, destructive conflict, and a low level of trust influence the relationship between IT investments and business performance.","['Diana Hoogeveen', 'Hans Oppelland']",50,"['004050d0-c5b4-4721-bd2c-f13b8ca8dcb5', '0d2ae8a3-f03c-467f-9806-5ea295478fde', '1d13bb3f-b6b6-43c6-a3c9-442e780af17c', '1dfaf309-ab99-4bc2-9332-aff7222c1d7d', '2d923c22-981b-4a50-8406-f2265601a4ff', '36b56ea0-6e82-4427-95ef-3b4b4d5980ff', '59b7757d-056f-4af6-b7c7-bdd99cca2072', '5e6ba10f-32c8-45c5-8e2d-52f5fc53c5f5', '7da2811c-a6df-4fd7-8c30-712957115c82', '8569a13d-e4de-41e7-85a5-b3eb6843fe52', 'a1fbcf87-8498-44de-8adc-4a6a7803dae0', 'aa24859d-1343-4cb2-b912-a458c6b488ca', 'b541380f-8e36-4fd8-91b3-04cf1f8d2736', 'ca8ceae7-35b3-4a07-93db-290b1660def6']",A socio political model of the relationship between IT investments and business performance,hawaii international conference on system sciences,2002,4ab9726b-6ad9-4f1d-b4e9-1b759ade7754

A statistical error model for varying word-lengths of PE stages of an FFT processor was developed to support this optimization flow. Experimental results designate that the word-length optimization employing the speedy flow reduces the percentage of the total area of the FFT processor that increases with an increasing FFT length. Finally, the proposed hybrid method requires a shorter prediction time than the absolute simulation-based method does and achieves more accurate outcomes than a statistical calculation does.","['Cheng-Yeh Wang', 'Chih-Bin Kuo', 'Jing-Yang Jou']",50,"['294b235e-e993-433f-9e33-a064c9062bfa', '72a03f33-1b02-4d6f-8235-4dc949650604', 'ddbbc737-b09c-454c-8564-73e515d77bcd']",Hybrid Wordlength Optimization Methods of Pipelined FFT Processors,IEEE Transactions on Computers,2007,4ab99c72-fc33-48d6-bcf6-55b927987db8

"In this paper, we derive throughput of a threshold-based transmission policy, namely load-regulated CSMA, taking into account the propagation delay of the medium and the offered load at different probability of the fading channel. In case of the saturated load regulated CSMA, a trivial relationship between deterministic offered load to the channel at a particular fading channel condition and the maximum possible offered load has been shown. We further extend the load regulation concept into multi-channel domain. Both single and multi-channel load regulated CSMA improves the throughput of the system compared to the existing CSMA system which does not consider channel fading to control the packet transmissions.","['Manzur Ashraf', 'Aruna Jayasuriya', 'Sylvie Perreau']",50,"['000d6977-a13e-456c-856c-c5c76137feb8', '0d5d6c89-52f5-4353-b8f7-be8e58633b60', '1b3c5c29-ef83-4db9-b8de-4c1079538fa7', '22360df6-03cc-4868-b6be-44414ae954b5', '4117117d-54b7-4c3b-b656-982e728cb380', '6325a998-889f-4766-8698-628da2a208be', '88bb3dc2-aada-4752-b1ba-760991984146', '8da72c47-4dac-4b24-99ee-5a0586907956', 'b317db7c-8101-4fbb-88f4-57f7b691e105', 'f875f646-8072-427f-b9dd-6b93312df6b8', 'f9ea7f88-61fc-46b7-b528-96c5127b1dc6']",On Load Regulated CSMA,international conference on distributed computing systems,2008,4ab9c94a-878b-4e57-b269-c86780f08766
"Constraint satisfaction modeling is both an efficient, and an elegant approach to model and solve many real world problems. In this paper, we present a constraint solver targeting module placement in static and partial run-time reconfigurable systems. We use the constraint solver to compute feasible placement positions. Our placement model incorporates communication, implementation variants and device configuration granularity. In addition, we model heterogeneous resources such as embedded memory, multipliers and logic. Furthermore, we take into account that logic resources consist of different types including logic only LUTs, arithmetic LUTs with carry chains, and LUTs with distributed memory. Our work targets state of the art field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) in both design-time and run-time applications. In order to evaluate our placement model and module placer implementation, we have implemented a repository containing 200 fully functional, placed and routed relocatable modules. The modules are used to implement complete systems. This validates the feasibility of both the model and the module placer. Furthermore, we present simulated results for run-time applications, and compare this to other state of the art research. In run-time applications, the results point to improved resource utilization. This is a result of using a finer tile grid and complex module shapes.","['Alexander Wold', 'Dirk Koch', 'Jim Torresen']",50,"['0798c266-ce48-4ee5-bb18-d0e85979b7db', '13b7fa01-076a-4b9c-8381-0e205491ca79', '1cebe9c6-4ce8-45c1-b320-8c0b0c50b51e', '3654e6ae-2171-4b58-9367-1b4cf406de71', '480423a4-19b6-40fb-a756-693115365e2d', '4b0834fb-34f9-447f-b4cd-e1217758ed26', '56e8d9b4-d707-4f81-861b-c46c95ca5326', '57e5d422-88a3-4746-a7c1-109c6b1ce899', '6cc0c000-c259-46d9-8079-ce8d305c0268', '77b210ae-4d55-42bf-a056-9e9fd4f434a9', '826126b9-8483-4efe-971d-1aa6cb179403', '8587c283-b363-4da0-ba0a-437dfe01842b', '9fe6f75d-031d-4a7f-81b1-47ead5f2f8ef', 'b0dc6795-684a-4dc9-a526-f032ef852ffb', 'bb405f68-f0ca-4588-9a20-ca7f5b81d4ba', 'c2ef7eac-b653-4773-b227-ddce32aaadcf', 'c6110398-f161-48ac-b708-0640555678bb', 'ced5d03c-2bea-4698-a602-fc6991d4b144', 'e9a47486-0e22-484c-83d2-ba69559e231d', 'f6fdc725-963e-47eb-bbdb-25abd2d58c5e']",Component based design using constraint programming for module placement on FPGAs,reconfigurable communication centric systems on chip,2013,4ab9d02e-f259-4c8b-8a32-446f46e39b9d

"Since the Standard Template Library (STL), generic libraries in C++ rely on concepts to precisely specify the requirements of generic algorithms (function templates) on their parameters (template arguments). Modifying the definition of a concept even slightly, can have a potentially large impact on the (interfaces of the) entire library. In particular the non-local effects of a change, however, make its impact difficult to determine by hand. In this paper we propose a conceptual change impact analysis (CCIA), which determines the impact of changes of the conceptual specification of a generic library. The analysis is organized in a pipe-and-filter manner, where the first stage finds any kind of impact, the second stage various specific kinds of impact. Both stages describe reachability algorithms, which operate on a conceptual dependence graph. In a case study, we apply CCIA to a new proposal for STL iterator concepts, which is under review by the C++ standardization committee. The analysis shows a number of unexpected incompatibilities and, for certain STL algorithms, a loss of genericity.","['Marcin Zalewski', 'Sibylle Schupp']",50,"['124e127e-0e00-45e0-8e01-43598f6a43e1', '1c53df06-408a-4357-83ee-e1b84e958303', '3b6770f9-09e3-4c0d-b2e9-ef7ada3f0878', '437981c1-f24a-4d6e-85a8-9aa2d3a60ff2', '5511b151-927c-4a7b-aaa3-9eff626512d3', '9136eb02-832e-49c2-b35a-30100217742c', 'a59a1097-b1c6-42a2-81ed-69d02d343d61', 'aabf3629-0b46-4505-9093-8b85553f14c1', 'bccd429a-7839-43ca-8784-128e4b5793e2', 'f5205d93-30a6-461a-b915-aeaa3e37ac82']",Change Impact Analysis for Generic Libraries,international conference on software maintenance,2006,4aba00f3-0b12-4c9d-83c0-4442b25ca4e6
"In the rapidly changing environment of Fast Moving Consumer Goods sector where new product launches are frequent, retail channels need to reallocate their shelf spaces intelligently while keeping up their total profit margins, and to simultaneously avoid product pollution. In this paper we propose an optimization model which yields the optimal product mix on the shelf in terms of profitability, and thus helps the retailers to use their shelves more effectively.

"Attacks exploiting race conditions have been considered rare and ""low risk"". However, the increasing popularity of multiprocessors has changed this situation: instead of waiting for the victim process to be suspended to carry out an attack, the attacker can now run on a dedicated processor and actively seek attack opportunities. This change from fortuitous encountering to active exploiting may greatly increase the success probability of race condition attacks. This point is exemplified by studying the TOCTTOU (Time-of- Check-to-Time-of-Use) race condition attacks in this paper. We first propose a probabilistic model for predicting TOCTTOU attack success rate on both uniprocessors and multiprocessors. Then we confirm the applicability of this model by carrying out TOCTTOU attacks against two widely used utility programs: vi and gedit. The success probability of attacking vi increases from low single digit percentage on a uniprocessor to almost 100% on a multiprocessor. Similarly, the success rate of attacking gedit jumps from almost zero to 83%. These case studies suggest that our model captures the sharply increased risks, and hence the decreased dependability of our systems, represented by race condition attacks such as TOCTTOU on the next generation multiprocessors.","['Jinpeng Wei', 'Calton Pu']",12,"['00f9e7df-444c-4c97-a13a-49ac6c337511', '07e7b7a7-0536-4448-aaf7-c5b3b3ba8af0', '119162d6-0403-4980-8096-f6fa5d9fc228', '16a85116-dd7c-45f6-b09b-5b0cc67dba94', '1f962aea-7b37-4172-a12b-6e4c43b2179e', '286322b3-fc17-4ebe-94f1-9c1a8d5e0588', '509473ba-ad2f-4706-89fc-4e537252a8b8', '8292e244-676f-4eeb-9b57-8df2ef9ce47f', '992751a0-5da1-4a86-9caf-3f5a8cb8ab6e', 'b4bb28e4-0487-4666-9d29-41b5208f6606', 'b5894e8e-1774-45b2-9b34-23d2330878d0', 'c853ace8-e939-469d-b910-0603c3e17456', 'd8b0b79d-dfe7-4aea-8128-8c10b5cab673', 'e41c1620-5347-4557-9c5d-6b9f2cef16f2', 'f692c7f5-4f84-4d52-9455-6658b778cd28', 'fb93297d-4d6b-4d81-91cc-45297a035faa']",Multiprocessors May Reduce System Dependability under File-Based Race Condition Attacks,dependable systems and networks,2007,4aba14e1-ed8b-4c0d-a1f5-2d29a9ca2670

The information extraction system is applied on a dataset made of 94 publications, and results in an acceptable accuracy. By storing extracted data into a table according to relations among the data, a dataset that can be used to predict nanomaterial environmental impact is obtained.

"Many versions of TCP have been proposed for transmitting data, and among them, TCP Reno is most widely used today. However, the problem, that it is difficult to use the wide bandwidth efficiently with TCP Reno, has been pointed out. HSTCP is one of the several new versions of TCP that are proposed to address this problem, but when its flows compete with TCP Reno flows at the same link, HSTCP gains most of the bandwidth and it is impossible to conduct fair transfer. In order to address this problem, we propose a two-level ECN marking to increase the frequency of congestion controls of HSTCP flows, holding its throughput. We evaluate our proposal through computer simulations, and the results show that our proposal mitigates bandwidth allocation to HSTCP, promoting fair transfer with TCP Reno.","['Fumiaki Hirose', 'Masahiko Fukuhara', 'Tomoya Hatano', 'Hiroshi Shigeno', 'Kenichi Okada']",0,"['1b13691b-4539-4fdc-900b-f39805da2e43', '7d0ca949-8bf5-4dc2-8b99-4e593b822323']",A two-level ECN marking for fair bandwidth allocation between HSTCP and TCP Reno,international conference on distributed computing systems,2005,4abae2f1-f25f-4098-89c8-8e59a1212397

"The noise sensitivity of low power circuits is rapidly increasing with the increasing levels of process variability and uncertainty. In this work, we study the problem of leakage power minimization in dual-Vdd and dual-Vth designs in the presence of significant Vth variation. The impact of the uncertainty in Vth on leakage power and timing are studied through probabilistic analytical models. We develop probabilistic models for timing slack and leakage power considering threshold variations with the objective of achieving an optimal selection of Vth. An analysis of the models indicate that, in the presence of variability, the value of the second Vth must be about 30mV higher than the Vth value obtained without considering variability. We show that our proposed method for the selection of Vth yields the lowest leakage power ratio of the dual-Vdd and dual-Vth versus the single-Vdd and single-Vth designs. In addition, the proposed models can be used to determine the ideal values for the second Vdd and Vth values in the context of variability for a variety of process conditions.","['Aswath Oruganti', 'Nagarajan Ranganathan']",8,"['281b8776-303b-46e1-b401-1998f69954a2', '3e9669f9-cbfe-42be-b733-e00f9719fe50', '599a8c3a-5ab3-415b-a498-8cac9e58d25d', '5af5382e-12c9-47a2-b545-000f3760fee8']",Leakage power reduction in dual-Vdd and dual-Vth designs through probabilistic analysis of Vth variation,international conference on vlsi design,2006,4abb12be-c61d-4a1e-b3ab-da6cee95b61b
"In this paper, a novel 3-D motion trajectory signature is introduced to serve as an effective description to the raw trajectory. More importantly, based on the trajectory signature, a probabilistic model-based cluster signature is further developed for modeling a motion class. The cluster signature is a mixture model-based motion description that is useful for motion class perception, recognition and to benefit a generalized robot task representation. The signature modeling process is supported by integrating the EM and IPRA algorithms. The conducted experiments verified the cluster signature's effectiveness.","['Shandong Wu', 'Youfu Li', 'Jianwei Zhang']",0,"['01f3fd52-f43a-4a76-b0ca-66a6459c15ac', '0610d61b-1e04-4b0d-ba1c-a13d06a8afb3', '15ed2eea-db9a-4cd1-9a18-50250aa7aa5f', '34a86c0c-0034-4f69-8faa-c9df26f6c272', '41b48676-1bd5-4665-8ada-14587c996390', '5f0280e3-be44-4e90-ba8c-30489973d1ce', '67827894-9e85-4879-9d9b-fe311f4abf90', '7344eecd-c482-4cab-9077-1aae93dc3bcd', '81261241-cb6c-434d-899d-8d45184d76d9', 'a5a4b29d-7692-443b-8954-fa3de81d0c8f', 'b0d27fea-64e2-47e1-91c6-edc2775ddf54', 'c21c324a-e578-4231-afbb-49fa0fed0203', 'db2420bf-e49c-40ac-baf1-5cdbfaa865d2', 'f276b25d-c7a2-4249-9bca-efac7f4864b9', 'f2cbc31a-35fb-47d5-bb69-fc1d60ccc1db']",Probabilistic Cluster Signature for Modeling Motion Classes,intelligent robots and systems,2009,4abb1623-b9d4-424d-ae02-7bea0d6108d5

"One important issue in designing medical knowledge-based systems is the management of uncertainty. Among the schemes that have been developed for this purpose, probability and CF (certainty factor) are the most widely used. If rules are organized according to a connectionist model, then neural network learning suggests a promising solution to this problem. When most rules are correct, semantically incorrect rules can be recognized if their associated certainty factors are weakened or change signs after training with correct samples. The techniques for rule base refinement are examined under this approach. The concept has been implemented and tested in an actual medical expert system. >",['Li-Min Fu'],50,"['6d903194-6be4-4780-9ccf-d60916e00770', 'c0301b1f-aaef-4f9e-8ce4-d4b1ef6c5e6d', 'cce26197-b613-4c74-bba2-07cf40e6bba4']",Refinement of medical knowledge bases: a neural network approach,computer-based medical systems,1990,4abb4018-46f7-4e6f-95e5-11a1e8ac1a1f
"This paper describes the architecture and implementation of a Java-based appliance for collaborative review of crashes involving injured children in order to determine mechanisms of injury. The multidisciplinary expertise needed for such reviews is not available at any one institution, resulting in the need for remote collaboration, while the sensitive nature of the information requires secure transmission and controlled access of data. The intended users of the appliance are researchers, engineers, medical doctors, government regulators, automobile and restraint manufacturers, insurance company representatives, and others who are interested in understanding the types and causes of injuries to children involved in motor vehicle crashes. The ultimate goal is to devise engineering solutions that prevent similar injuries from occurring in the future. The collaboration appliance (called Telecenter) enables the following activities: (1) the distributed asynchronous collection of digital content needed for each crash case review under a scheme that consistently organizes content across multiple cases; (2) the secure, Web-based remote participation of users in case-review meetings that involve viewing of case-specific content, live communication (written or verbal), multimedia access and sharing (slide presentations/ images), and use of Web resources; and (3) archival and post-review access of case reviews for follow-up activities and other functions (e.g., statistics, search, and networking). The Telecenter design supports audio conferencing, remote delivery and viewing of slide presentations, and other collaboration features also available in commercial and public-domain collaboration middleware products. However, it goes beyond existing solutions by also embedding a specific workflow and content organization suited for traffic injury reviews, supporting spatio-temporal role-based access control, distributed management of content and seamless integration of existing services. The current status and experience from using an early prototype of the Telecenter in actual case reviews are discussed, along with planned extensions to its functionality.","['Mahendra Kumar', 'Richard E.

We advocate that the use of mobile data services can be associated with one's level of satisfaction with his/her life. Based on the findings of a questionnaire-based survey (N=388), we have found that users satisfied with their personal life use information, mobile e-mail, and stock broking services more frequently than dissatisfied ones, while users satisfied with their professional life tend to use financial, information, and mobile e-mail services more heavily. Furthermore, we identify early adopters' profiles in terms of their demographic characteristics (gender, age, education, and income) to inform the design of effective target marketing strategies.","['Maria Bina', 'George M.

"Channels with a long but sparse impulse response arise in a variety of wireless communication applications, such as high definition television (HDTV) terrestrial transmission and underwater acoustic communications. By adopting the $\ell_1$-norm as the sparsity metric of the channel response, the channel estimation is formulated as a complex-valued convex optimization problem. A fast fixed point iteration algorithm is developed to solve the resultant complex-valued $\ell_1$-minimization problem. The proposed fast channel estimation algorithm is easy to implement and has a low computational complexity of $O(N\log N)$ per iteration with $N$ the signal length.

"Matching visual patterns that appear scaled, rotated, and deformed with respect to each other is a challenging problem. We propose a linear formulation that simultaneously matches feature points and estimates global geometrical transformation in a constrained linear space. The linear scheme enables search space reduction based on the lower convex hull property so that the problem size is largely decoupled from the original hard combinatorial problem. Our method therefore can be used to solve large scale problems that involve a very large number of candidate feature points. Without using prepruning in the search, this method is more robust in dealing with weak features and clutter. We apply the proposed method to action detection and image matching. Our results on a variety of images and videos demonstrate that our method is accurate, efficient, and robust.","['Hao Jiang', 'Stella X. Yu', 'David R.

"Key establishment in sensor networks is a challenging problem because asymmetric key cryptosystems are unsuitable for use in resource constrained sensor nodes, and also because the nodes could be physically compromised by an adversary. We present three new mechanisms for key establishment using the framework of pre-distributing a random set of keys to each node. First, in the q-composite keys scheme, we trade off the unlikeliness of a large-scale network attack in order to significantly strengthen random key predistribution's strength against smaller-scale attacks. Second, in the multipath-reinforcement scheme, we show how to strengthen the security between any two nodes by leveraging the security of other links. Finally, we present the random-pairwise keys scheme, which perfectly preserves the secrecy of the rest of the network when any node is captured, and also enables node-to-node authentication and quorum-based revocation.","['Haowen Chan', 'Adrian Perrig', 'Dawn Xiaodong Song']",3767,"['05f73279-fa9c-48ef-a9c2-91ac38caaf23', '0b868c0b-2b01-4732-abfb-06a8773783cb', '3fb43b00-905c-4a08-934d-198ea4eb66c3', '4502aa3d-d723-4034-9418-cd6b851b8f05', '491b1093-c88e-4593-bd7d-9550ec5934b6', '51af4708-b81c-4362-b4ee-7bdf7ace609f', '59054202-3dbe-424a-bd0a-b70986faf2ed', '59660d1e-9231-4ff9-86b3-6cd646239eae', '5b4042f4-f57a-442f-81bf-be2b2f09f846', '668f4a29-4f19-4f95-8051-ad912a1b7de9', '8828d2f5-0b50-4715-863d-66c787fc40e0', '905daad3-ccb6-470e-9bdf-e4753e9c0083', '9235dd52-331c-483b-b805-b3bb7d1a5448', 'a3a44806-1b80-4340-a0e2-b0be96f09fc8', 'b526a4e4-3e02-44d6-8b86-4f003dda0c6e', 'bdc23497-23e9-44d4-84d3-359ec1b8af5d', 'bf2e4bc7-c465-43c7-85ca-80cd98efe735', 'ca394e6a-59e0-466c-a66a-d976555db689', 'cf00af6f-5ecb-40bf-a578-91c39b9642f5', 'd240119d-940d-4c54-a4fa-fe14424c3de9', 'db009a21-2f63-4336-b079-0fa8e1a6f609', 'fd9441f9-759d-4ee4-95fe-53a189c2f539']",Random key predistribution schemes for sensor networks,ieee symposium on security and privacy,2003,4abc6eba-0535-46df-94c7-f3a6a7c6f2ed

Standard deviation of CT-values was employed as a physical index for evaluating image noise, and streak artifact was quantitatively evaluated using our devised Gumbel evaluation method.  z -Axis automatic tube current modulation technique will improve image noise and streak artifact, compared with fixed tube current technique, and will make it possible to significantly reduce radiation doses at lung levels while maintaining the same image quality as fixed tube current technique.","['Kuniharu Imai', 'Mitsuru Ikeda', 'Yukihiro Enchi', 'Takanaga Niimi']",50,[],Quantitative assessment of image noise and streak artifact on CT image: comparison of z-axis automatic tube current modulation technique with fixed tube current technique.,Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics,2009,4abc79b3-b9ff-47bd-996e-f01d0636f5bb
"Unlike the traditional integrated supplier-buyer coordination model, this research incorporates overlapped delivery and imperfect items into the production-distribution model. This model improves the observable fact that the system might experience shortage during the screening duration and also takes quantity discount into account. This approach has not been discussed in previous integrated supplier-buyer coordination models. The expected annual integrated total cost function is derived and properties and theorems are explored to help develop an algorithm. A solution procedure, free from the convexity associated with an algorithm is established to find the optimal solution. A numerical example is given to illustrate the proposed procedure and algorithm. A sensitivity analysis is made to investigate the effects of five important parameters (the inspect rate, the annual demand, the defective rate, the holding cost, and the receiving cost) on the optimal solution.

"A Monte Carlo simulation of photon propagation through human skin and interaction with a subcutaneous fluorescent sensing layer is presented. The algorithm will facilitate design of an optical probe for an implantable fluorescent sensor, which holds potential for monitoring many parameters of biomedical interest. Results are analyzed with respect to output light intensity as a function of radial distance from source, angle of exit for escaping photons, and sensor fluorescence (SF) relative to tissue autofluorescence (AF). A sensitivity study was performed to elucidate the effects on the output due to changes in optical properties, thickness of tissue layers, thickness of the sensor layer, and both tissue and sensor quantum yields. The optical properties as well as the thickness of the stratum corneum, epidermis, (tissue layers through which photons must pass to reach the sensor) and the papillary dermis (tissue distal to sensor) are highly influential. The spatial emission profile of the SF is broad compared that of the tissue fluorescence and the ratio of sensor to tissue fluorescence increases with distance from the source. The angular distribution of escaping photons is more concentrated around the normal for SF than for tissue AF. The information gained from these simulations will he helpful in designing appropriate optics for collection of the signal of interest.","['Michael J. McShane', 'Sohi Rastegar', 'Michael V.

"Background: Currently primary scientific data, especially that dealing with biodiversity, is neither easily discoverable nor accessible. Amongst several impediments, one is a lack of professional recognition of scientific data publishing efforts. A possible solution is establishment of a ‘Data Publishing Framework’ which would encourage and recognise investments and efforts by institutions and individuals towards management, and publishing of primary scientific data potentially on a par with recognitions received for scholarly publications. Discussion: This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of primary biodiversity data publishing, and conceptualises a ‘Data Publishing Framework’ that would help incentivise efforts and investments by institutions and individuals in facilitating free and open access to biodiversity data. It further postulates the institutionalisation of a ‘Data Usage Index (DUI)’, that would attribute due recognition to multiple players in the data collection/creation, management and publishing cycle. Conclusion: We believe that institutionalisation of such a ‘Data Publishing Framework’ that offers socio-cultural, legal, technical, economic and policy environment conducive for data publishing will facilitate expedited discovery and mobilisation of an exponential increase in quantity of ‘fit-for-use’ primary biodiversity data, much of which is currently invisible.","['Vishwas Chavan', 'Peter Ingwersen']",61,"['207ef7c7-621a-496b-817f-15970e462ea8', '28acdbdc-467c-4482-9b1a-2a5a4fe0f496', '2bcf0334-5851-4fc2-ad34-9a0eb7393648', '49498f57-74ca-46db-9986-f79ed7281a0e', '771c119a-c227-49f9-a37c-2d9b26c444d7', '8673c5a0-81c6-40f8-abbb-1436a19034b0', '8cd34a37-d837-4f5a-94bd-7bac2e297884', 'a60ca42c-ee9b-4933-a753-971959bfdd42', 'bae353da-c76a-45d6-88a2-b7478b7eb33f', 'c5583ade-f07d-4e6c-a0d4-a0729e529bc0', 'cb9ec427-9db6-4407-9f3f-5df662829642', 'cc9463cf-83b9-4f17-b5d8-053dff6b7264', 'd380b945-7851-4cc1-a922-e6b5fbd18e76']",Towards a data publishing framework for primary biodiversity data: challenges and potentials for the biodiversity informatics community,BMC Bioinformatics,2009,4abc9591-ed35-4e56-a841-e020c73b78c8
"In this paper we present a detailed analysis on how the critical charge (Q/sub crit/) of a circuit node, usually employed to evaluate the probability of transient fault (TF) occurrence as a consequence of a particle hit, depends on transistors' sizing. We derive an analytical model allowing us to calculate a node's Q/sub crit/ given the size of the node's driving gate and fan-out gate(s), thus avoiding time costly electrical level simulations. We verified that such a model features an accuracy of the 97% with respect to electrical level simulations performed by HSPICE. Our proposed model shows that Q/sub crit/ depends much more on the strength (conductance) of the gate driving the node, than on the node total capacitance. We also evaluated the impact of increasing the conductance of the driving gate on TFs' propagation, hence on soft error susceptibility (SES). We found that such a conductance increase not only improves the TF robustness of the hardened node, but also that of the whole circuit.","['José Manuel Cazeaux', 'Daniele Rossi', 'Martin Omana', 'Cecilia Metra', 'Abhijit Chatterjee']",55,"['09cbec93-6180-4b70-8b5d-1c4db1218170', '1c7ab87f-70ca-4ce0-b904-0b039c3e0410', '3a8672df-efe3-40aa-a9dc-4ad7342f4eef', '6842ba32-62d9-43f9-b0af-eb4089cc821b', '6cd4e6eb-7357-4432-9a20-cf8a6fe1b475', '8146e31c-d33f-4c61-95b1-8628746bae6b', '9f11d87b-0fbd-4da0-a50c-8d2e1c8e066c', 'e82dd171-3347-46f5-a377-a5afad687f00']",On transistor level gate sizing for increased robustness to transient faults,international on line testing symposium,2005,4abcb13b-04f9-468a-9eb9-d75dd46fd4bd
"Since the third wave in human–computer interaction HCI, research on user experience UX has gained momentum within the HCI community. The focus has shifted from systematic usability requirements and measures towards guidance on designing for experiences. This is a big change, since design has traditionally not played a large role in HCI research. Yet, the literature addressing this shift in focus is very limited. We believe that the field of UX research can learn from a field where design and experiential aspects have always been important: design research. In this article, we discuss why design is needed in UX research and how research that includes design as a part of research can support and advance UX design practice. We do this by investigating types of design-inclusive UX research and by learning from real-life cases of UX-related design research. We report the results of an interview study with 41 researchers in three academic research units where design research meets UX research. Based on our interview findings, and building on existing literature, we describe the different roles design can play in research projects. We also report how design research results can inform designing for experience methodologically or by providing new knowledge on UX. The results are presented in a structured palette that can help UX researchers reflect and focus more on design in their research projects, thereby tackling experience design challenges in their own research.","['Arnold P.

"This paper presents a framework for wearable computing, based on the principle that it be unobtrusive, and that it be integrated into ordinary clothing. This design philosophy, called 'eudaemonic computing' (named in honor of the group of physicists who designed the first truly unobtrusive wearable computers with vibrotactile displays) is reduced to practice through the 'underwearable computer' ('underwearable' for short). The 'underwearable' is a computer system that is meant to be worn within or under ordinary clothing. The first 'underwearables' were built in the early 1980s, and have evolved into a form that very much resembles a tank-top. There were three reasons for the tank structure: (1) weight is evenly and comfortably distributed over the body, and bulk is distributed unobtrusively; (2) it provides privacy by situating the apparatus within the corporeal boundary we consider our own (personal) space, and others also so-regard; and (3) proximity to the body affords capability to both sense biological signal quantities (such as respiration and heart signals which are both accessible to a vest-based device), as well as produce output that we can sense, unobtrusively. The vibrotactile output modality (VibraVest) was explored as a means of assisting the visually challenged (to avoid bumping into objects through an ability to 'feel' objects at a distance). The success of VibraVest suggests other possibilities for similar unobtrusive devices that can be worn over an extended period of time, in all facets of day-to-day life.",['Steve Mann'],50,"['1498caf0-7061-404f-99ae-36f5dc651457', '2f5277d1-fc05-4803-923b-5c6bbefbbfe8', '49fdb640-ed0b-4d84-aceb-60bc00fb8cdc', 'c2adf1e1-2bfa-426f-a0d8-d979fe122c88']",Eudaemonic computing ('underwearables'),,1997,4abd36bd-6021-4e5f-ac08-4990a9683f86

"Web Information Systems (WIS) use the Web paradigm and technologies to retrieve information from sources connected to the Web, and present the information in a web or hypermedia presentation to the user. Hera is a design methodology that supports the design of WIS. It is a model -driven method that distinguishes integration, data gathering, and presentation generation. In this paper we address the Hera methodology and specifically explain the integration model that covers the different aspects of integration, and the adaptation model, that specifies how the generated presentations are adaptable (e.g. device capabilities, user preferences). The Hera software framework provides a set of transformations that allow a WIS to go from integration to presentation generation. These transformations are based on RDF(S), and we show how RDF(S) has proven its value in combining all relevant aspects of WIS design. In this way, RDF(S) being the foundation of the Semantic Web, Hera allows the engineering of Semantic Web Information Systems (SWIS).","['G.J.P.M.

"The optimal wiresizing problem for nets with multiple sources is studied under the distributed Elmore delay model. We decompose such a net into a source subtree (SST) and a set of loading subtrees (LSTs), and show the optimal wiresizing solution satisfies a number of interesting properties, including: the LST separability, the LST monotone property, the SST local monotone property and the general dominance property. Furthermore, we study the optimal wiresizing problem using a variable grid and reveal the bundled refinement property. These properties lead to efficient algorithms to compute the lower and upper bounds of the optimal solutions. Experiment results on nets from an Intel processor layout show an interconnect delay reduction of up to 35.9\% when compared to the minimum-width solution. In addition, the algorithm based on a variable grid yields a speedup of two orders of magnitude without loss of accuracy, when compared with the fixed grid based methods.","['Jason Cong', 'Lei He']",86,"['076ddce8-b26f-4411-b7f7-955b35b6c244', '0ac9e569-7420-46c1-906a-a3afb767a546', '16f95a47-5bfc-4cdd-ab0e-3e7fdabca8d7', '19308eb1-4140-4f41-999b-b2ba379564d5', '242d2b5a-6dad-4fe7-bbf5-3e1217f702f1', '340b0788-9cde-4d99-8ab0-af9a6edf9ac9', '3be49c80-f239-49c5-874b-712398a5a76b', '3c6e0d10-ffce-419d-8c5b-b93a40602b51', '62c657d9-c151-4eed-b01f-f06a336acfc2', '80e438f4-ed89-4d30-aebd-6a71a1e8ab24', '9467af20-da29-4125-bff1-7a55b7fb5e92', '9e7581d2-952c-449c-8d71-f4fc50b088f1', 'a25f1374-9be8-4cfe-af3b-7a967c88c216', 'a3d404e1-09d9-4dea-b5b8-79138cfbfa39', 'acabfe0c-d7fb-42d0-a5e0-c15c84d8ee76', 'c0689d55-e7ea-4854-ad02-eb0677ce5d36', 'c4239e3d-6c6a-4658-b2e8-60400f526087', 'dfe5ac81-b61e-4178-ad8a-9c686124502c', 'efe31909-3d07-48c1-b1ed-994f2beb340a']",Optimal wiresizing for interconnects with multiple sources,international conference on computer aided design,1995,4abd9035-7495-4b96-a5d6-25aa66a8a240

Differences between non-reward- and reward-predicting cues were localized in the cuneus and later in the dorsal PCC, suggesting a modulation by potential reward information during early visual processing, followed by a coarse emotional evaluation of the cues. Oscillatory analysis revealed increased theta power after non-reward cues over fronto-central sites. In the beta range, power decreased with the magnitude of the potential reward and increased with re- action time, probably reflecting the influence of the striatal response to potential reward on the sensorimotor cortex. At reward delivery, negative prediction errors led to a larger mediofrontal negativity. The spatiotem- poral evolution of reward processing was modulated by prediction error: whereas differences were located in PCC and putamen in the prediction error comparison, in the case of expected outcomes they were located in PCC, ACC and parahippocampal gyrus. In the oscillatory realm, theta power was largest following rewards and, in the case of non-rewards, was largest when these were unexpected. Higher beta activity following re- wards was also observed in both modalities, but MEG additionally showed a significant power decrease for this condition over parieto-occipital sensors. Our results show how visual, limbic and striatal structures are involved in the different stages of reward anticipation and delivery, and how theta and beta oscillations have a prominent role in the processing of these stimuli.","['Nuria Doñamayor', 'M.

"In this paper, we analyze people’s reading and commenting behaviors in blogspace and proposed an algorithm for blog ranking. Upon two selected communities, AI and Medical, we show how comments, reading records, active browsing and multi time browsing can help to construct the weblog graph and reflect a blog’s popularity. Based on these analysis, we propose cRank, a graph based algorithm, to rank blog among community members. Finally, we divide our dataset temporally and present how the proposed algorithm can make prediction on blogs’ rankings. The experiment shows that cRank has a better performance upon several baseline systems.","['Songxiang Cen', 'Li Han', 'Jian Ma']",2,"['2256cad0-cf03-42da-bcf3-4a89be0ebf8e', '489307c6-d0d4-4d16-80c1-4966e67e0a54', '92672b9b-e033-470e-9c1e-4311f059e31c', '9bd3b8dd-728e-4476-a3b8-f7b08f51bb78', 'b6f60fbd-c58f-4ca3-9a6d-da75ff79b434', 'c7e4e04b-45da-4bae-8c8a-d17ca0087361', 'd15d0abd-4171-4a74-b882-6379d698c74e', 'eab0033d-ad60-487b-b88d-e53b58d82195']",Ranking Weblogs by Analyzing Reading and Commenting Activities,web intelligence,2009,4abdc51e-88a0-4730-901f-6b9756384e14
"Robust and accurate lip region segmentation is of vital importance for lip image analysis. However, most of the current techniques break down in the presence of mustaches and beards. With mustaches and beards, the background region becomes complex and inhomogeneous. We propose in this paper a novel multi-class, shape-guided FCM (MS-FCM) clustering algorithm to solve this problem. For this new approach, one cluster is set for the object, i.e. the lip region, and a combination of multiple clusters for the background which generally includes the skin region, lip shadow or beards. The proper number of background clusters is derived automatically which maximizes a cluster validity index. A spatial penalty term considering the spatial location information is introduced and incorporated into the objective function such that pixels having similar color but located in different regions can be differentiated. This facilitates the separation of lip and background pixels that otherwise are inseparable due to the similarity in color. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm provides accurate lip-background partition even for the images with complex background features like mustaches and beards.","['Shilin Wang', 'Wing Hong Lau', 'Alan Wee-Chung Liew', 'Shu Hung Leung']",57,"['05f67623-5dc8-4f5d-b778-0cc8f9a629f4', '1fbc2c93-b441-4950-b827-7eda24e9d253', '21d485b7-8eba-4fc0-9df7-87b1f23ffcd0', '258f2c9e-3d3f-459a-a75e-c75cf7f5e1fe', '2a8049d1-5cba-45f8-890e-cc1265d66989', '3c52ba53-374e-440c-b519-102d58a83182', '65232212-70b5-4470-8724-6f95e6d78192', '6c8acb9d-fe84-4e17-9b44-5c33aaefd611', '7a3c432e-689b-4971-a3db-1607bbde461c', '81087879-e157-457f-ab55-c3a033bb396e', 'f2ae6c2d-9435-4954-8700-8aff049c0cf6']",Robust lip region segmentation for lip images with complex background,Pattern Recognition,2007,4abddb85-1a82-42ac-9458-b5ba17538514

The problem is intriguing in that the system matrix does not have to be Hurwitz in any time instant. We have established the main result by a combination of the Lyapunov stability analysis and a generalized Barbalat's Lemma applicable to piecewise continuous linear systems. As applications of this stability result, we study both the leaderless consensus problem and the leader-following consensus problem for general marginally stable linear multi-agent systems under switching network topology.

"This paper describes a new approach, based on linear programming, for computing nonnegative matrix factorizations (NMFs). The key idea is a data-driven model for the factorization where the most salient features in the data are used to express the remaining features. More precisely, given a data matrix X, the algorithm identifies a matrix C that satisfies X ≈ CX and some linear constraints. The constraints are chosen to ensure that the matrix C selects features; these features can then be used to find a low-rank NMF of X. A theoretical analysis demonstrates that this approach has guarantees similar to those of the recent NMF algorithm of Arora et al. (2012). In contrast with this earlier work, the proposed method extends to more general noise models and leads to efficient, scalable algorithms. Experiments with synthetic and real datasets provide evidence that the new approach is also superior in practice. An optimized C++ implementation can factor a multigigabyte matrix in a matter of minutes.","['Ben Recht', 'Christopher Ré', 'Joel A.

We describe and show the results of video coding based on a three-dimensional (3-D) spatio-temporal subband decomposition. The results include a 1-Mbps coder based on a new adaptive differential pulse code modulation scheme (ADPCM) and adaptive bit allocation. This rate is useful for video storage on CD-ROM. Coding results are also shown for a 384-kbps rate that are based on ADPCM for the lowest frequency band and a new form of vector quantization (geometric vector quantization (GVQ)) for the data in the higher frequency bands. GVQ takes advantage of the inherent structure and sparseness of the data in the higher bands. Results are also shown for a 128-kbps coder that is based on an unbalanced tree-structured vector quantizer (UTSVQ) for the lowest frequency band and GVQ for the higher frequency bands. The results are competitive with traditional video coding techniques and provide the motivation for investigating the 3-D subband framework for different coding schemes and various applications. >,"['Christine I.

This article discusses the usage of executable UML state machines for system modeling, i.e. usage of the same formalism for describing the state-based dynamic behavior of physical system components and software. Moreover, it points out that the usage of Modelica as an action language enables an integrated simulation of continuous-time and reactive/event-based system dynamics.

"Existing convex relaxation-based approaches to reconstruction in compressed sensing assume that noise in the measurements is independent of the signal of interest. We consider the case of noise being linearly correlated with the signal and introduce a simple technique for improving compressed sensing reconstruction from such measurements. The technique is based on a linear model of the correlation of additive noise with the signal. The modification of the reconstruction algorithm based on this model is very simple and has negligible additional computational cost compared to standard reconstruction algorithms, but is not known in existing literature. The proposed technique reduces reconstruction error considerably in the case of linearly correlated measurements and noise. Numerical experiments confirm the efficacy of the technique. The technique is demonstrated with application to low-rate quantization of compressed measurements, which is known to introduce correlated noise, and improvements in reconstruction error compared to ordinary Basis Pursuit De-Noising of up to approximately 7dB are observed for 1bit/sample quantization. Furthermore, the proposed method is compared to Binary Iterative Hard Thresholding which it is demonstrated to outperform in terms of reconstruction error for sparse signals with a number of non-zero coefficients greater than approximately 1/10th of the number of compressed measurements.","['Thomas Arildsen', 'Torben Larsen']",10,"['1bebd507-c40b-46be-b558-287313ab1f64', '36e425e3-a7a4-4c1a-b9b2-f066f81eef1d', '45923db6-f9c1-4c79-9d41-786dd885c8b5', '4d834f29-431a-44ba-b719-4aefc9dd9d29', '5b8c5edb-1f21-4e1d-9bc4-aa9d5dbec473', '65442c7a-3c03-4afe-b022-757a0c3f1707', '6ed846f2-986a-4d98-8bc0-c40e038b61a0', '6ff01654-66d1-49c7-b526-1c8ed7fa893a', '71a18de9-e543-4337-ab7a-3db31d9f8c00', '74b9aa5f-e5e4-4789-a5ca-254030320eca', 'a53a3dda-b003-4d5c-96b1-e9afd8e35692', 'da21037b-ebf1-4784-8369-ffda480b5154', 'da3591c1-6a8f-4ac3-8481-b1fe147deb85', 'dcb3aa3e-2c0b-4547-8a8c-fe69d772e281', 'e646894c-ef05-4a9f-953e-dbe44381da4f', 'e7af7694-28e7-4b6a-b23c-b7f4f8647ed2', 'f56b877b-4060-4754-b303-e8140968544c']",Compressed sensing with linear correlation between signal and measurement noise,Signal Processing,2014,4abe757f-e291-4509-adcb-6bac80846184

"The classification performance of nearest prototype classifiers largely relies on the prototype learning algorithms, such as the learning vector quantization (LVQ) and the minimum classification error (MCE). This paper proposes a new prototype learning algorithm based on the minimization of a conditional log-likelihood loss (CLL), called log-likelihood of margin (LOGM). A regularization term is added to avoid over-fitting in training. The CLL loss in LOGM is a convex function of margin, and so, gives better convergence than the MCE algorithm. Our empirical study on a large suite of benchmark datasets demonstrates that the proposed algorithm yields higher accuracies than the MCE, the generalized LVQ (GLVQ), and the soft nearest prototype classifier (SNPC).","['Xiao-Bo Jin', 'Cheng-Lin Liu', 'Xinwen Hou']",50,"['30125a55-cddc-45a8-89cc-816a6a8b9f59', '5df8a66b-20d1-4e6c-ab02-cffe9cb76a0f', '75235960-2f8a-453a-b8d4-bf55d282c817', '836a3ebe-13e2-4f46-9a2f-c42624c1f1c0', 'a87f974b-a5ac-4af5-9301-8e6c548da08e', 'c1e5cd4e-d1fa-454a-8edd-c5e2138dc5ed']",Prototype learning with margin-based conditional log-likelihood loss,international conference on pattern recognition,2008,4abe949b-1122-46ff-a7e5-9bc8cffb7971

"In the software development, most stakeholders cannot clearly and objectively express their needs for the envisioned software systems. In this paper, we propose a problem-driven collaborative requirements elicitation approach, with the purpose of helping identify and extract the requirements of the Internetwares (a complex and new software paradigm). The basic idea of our approach is that the requirements of the software systems should be stated by stakeholders in an objective way (i.e. problem-identifying-solving way). That is, first identify the problems existed in the as-is problem domain, and then find the solutions to the problems. The solutions to the problems are the requirements of the envisioned software systems. To this end, we propose the structure of problems and a collaborative process for achieving the solutions.","['Bo Wang', 'Haiyan Zhao', 'Wei Zhang', 'Zhi Jin', 'Hong Mei']",1,"['1a345fe4-f9ca-4768-a4d2-7544f8115279', '1c43b91b-8973-4773-ae23-7a4f4a0adc58', '3a039977-480e-4f87-b66f-c483eef11295', '3c230882-c6e5-4915-bbae-a4e8cfb87137', 'b30bb131-d5d5-455f-a345-5d00d4f33687', 'bd3e359b-4005-46ef-a1d7-cda559f46fed', 'c399a9cb-515a-4dfe-b6c5-81ffc7a3e1a1']",A problem-driven collaborative approach to eliciting requirements of internetwares,,2010,4abea27d-0ba4-41b0-9a2a-79a7a47623c3

"This research is motivated by a scheduling problem found in the diffusion and oxidation areas of semiconductor wafer fabrication, where the machines can be modeled as parallel batch processors. We attempt to minimize total weighted tardiness on parallel batch machines with incompatible job families and unequal ready times of the jobs. Given that the problem is NP-hard, we propose two different decomposition approaches. The first approach forms fixed batches, then assigns these batches to the machines using a genetic algorithm (GA), and finally sequences the batches on individual machines. The second approach first assigns jobs to machines using a GA, then forms batches on each machine for the jobs assigned to it, and finally sequences these batches. Dispatching and scheduling rules are used for the batching phase and the sequencing phase of the two approaches. In addition, as part of the second decomposition approach, we develop variations of a time window heuristic based on a decision theory approach for forming and sequencing the batches on a single machine.","['Lars Mönch', 'Hari Balasubramanian', 'John W.

"Associating fMRI image datasets with the available literature is crucial for the analysis and interpretation of fMRI data. Here, we present a human brain function mapping knowledge-base system (BrainKnowledge) that associates fMRI data analysis and literature search functions. BrainKnowledge not only contains indexed literature, but also provides the ability to compare experimental data with those derived from the literature. BrainKnowledge provides three major functions: (1) to search for brain activation models by selecting a particular brain function; (2) to query functions by brain structure; (3) to compare the fMRI data with data extracted from the literature. All these functions are based on our literature extraction and mining module developed earlier (Hsiao, Chen, Chen. Journal of Biomedical Informatics 42, 912–922, 2009), which automatically downloads and extracts information from a vast amount of fMRI literature and generates co-occurrence models and brain association patterns to illustrate the relevance of brain structures and functions. BrainKnowledge currently provides three co-occurrence models: (1) a structure-to-function co-occurrence model; (2) a function-to-structure co-occurrence model; and (3) a brain structure co-occurrence model. Each model has been generated from over 15,000 extracted Medline abstracts. In this study, we illustrate the capabilities of BrainKnowledge and provide an application example with the studies of affect. BrainKnowledge, which combines fMRI experimental results with Medline abstracts, may be of great assistance to scientists not only by freeing up resources and valuable time, but also by providing a powerful tool that collects and organizes over ten thousand abstracts into readily usable and relevant sources of information for researchers.","['Mei-Yu Hsiao', 'Chien-Chung Chen', 'Jyh-Horng Chen']",1,"['5c9b5ad7-063b-4157-acb9-014b705dcaed', 'a637d76b-ab24-49ca-8bd6-451888de47c0', 'a903b942-f49b-4b80-b419-b6bfcf54753d', 'bddef380-acb0-40c3-bfad-04bf93a5ae62', 'd451b4a9-d740-4c69-9200-46b7cefd91fd']",BrainKnowledge: A Human Brain Function Mapping Knowledge-Base System,Neuroinformatics,2011,4abec1f7-b21f-4a54-9ef6-cfbdc8c63a59
"In this paper we address the problem of radio resource allocation for QoS support in the downlink of a cellular OFDMA system. The major impairments considered are cochannel interference (CCI) and frequency selective fading. The allocation problem involves assignment of base stations and subcarriers, bit loading, and power control, for multiple users. We propose a three-stage, low-complexity, heuristic algorithm to distribute radio resources among multiple users according to their individual QoS requirements, while at the same time maintaining the QoS of already established links in all the cochannel cells. The allocation objective is to minimize the total transmit power, which adds to reducing CCI. Simulation results show a superior performance of the proposed method when compared to classical radio resource management techniques. Our scheme allows us to achieve almost 6 times higher capacity (sum data rate) than the method based on FDMA with power control, at a blocking probability of 0.02.","['Slawomir Pietrzyk', 'Gerard J.

"In this sketch we present a new method for rendering large-scale, high-resolution, non-repetitive textures in real-time using multi layer texturing. The basic idea of spectral texturing is to construct the nal texture by multiple texture layers where each layer provides a certain range of the spectrum of the texture’s spatial frequencies. Alpha channels are used to introduce statistical dependencies between the frequency bands. This approach extends a method called detail texturing, which does not use alpha channels to model higher statistical properties of the resulting texture. Other approaches to generate textures with specied statistical properties, like [DeBonet 1997], are not suitable for real-time use and would require storage of the generated texture. Spectral texturing is very easy to implement, runs on all contemporary 3d graphics cards, and is especially suitable for naturalistic textures in real-time applications which are viewed from a large range of distances.",['Daniel R.

"Forest management issues are increasingly required to be addressed in a spatial context, which has led to the development of spatially explicit forest landscape models. The numerous processes, complex spatial interactions, and diverse applications in spatial modeling make the development of forest landscape models difficult for any single research group. New developments in componentbased modeling approaches provide a viable solution. Component-based modeling breaks a monolithic model into small, interchangeable, and binary components. They have these advantages compared to the traditional modeling work: 1) developing a component is a much smaller task than developing a whole model, 2) a component can be developed using most programming languages, since the interface format is binary, and 3) new components can replace the existing ones under the same model framework; this reduces the duplication and allows the modeling community to focus resources on the common products, and to compare results. In this paper, we explore the design of a spatially explicit forest landscape model in a component-based modeling framework, based on our work on object-oriented forest landscape modeling. We examine the representation of the major components and the interactions between them. Our goal is to facilitate the use of the component-based modeling approach at the early stage of spatially explicit landscape modeling.  2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.","['Hong S.

"Motivation: The prediction of localization sites of various proteins is an important and challenging problem in the field of molecular biology. TargetP, by Emanuelsson et al. (J. Mol. Biol., 300, 1005‐1016, 2000) is a neural network based system which is currently the best predictor in the literature for N-terminal sorting signals. One drawback of neural networks, however, is that it is generally difficult to understand and interpret how and why they make such predictions. In this paper, we aim to generate simple and interpretable rules as predictors, and still achieve a practical prediction accuracy. We adopt an approach which consists of an extensive search for simple rules and various attributes which is partially guided by human intuition. Results: We have succeeded in finding rules whose prediction accuracies come close to that of TargetP, while still retaining a very simple and interpretable form. We also discuss and interpret the discovered rules.

"Abstract#R##N##R##N#For high-fidelity color reproduction with digital color platemaking systems, it is the most important to determine the color masking matrix which converts the red, green and blue intensities of the monitor to cyan, magenta, yellow and black inks halftone dot area rates. With regard to this determination process, the author previously developed a color difference least square method by which the optimum matrix is determined, using a simulation with the Neugebauer equation and virtual color samples. First, this paper evaluates the method with actual images. Next, the method is extended for adaptive masking matrix optimization. By adapting the matrix to each color image using black ink, it was shown that the average color differences of reproduced images could be reduced to below six when black ink is used as much as possible, i.e., in the case of achromatic printing. This masking matrix adaption is a new concept which was impossible by conventional color scanner processing, but became possible by using virtual color samples.",['Johji Tajima'],0,,"Optimum color masking matrix determination for digital color platemaking, using virtual color samples",Systems and Computers in Japan,1989,4abef7ce-25c6-48ad-874d-b802070622af
"In this paper, we propose a downlink transmission strategy based on intercell interference pricing and a distributed algorithm that enables each base station (BS) to design locally its own beamforming vectors without relying on downlink channel state information of links from other BSs to the users. This algorithm is the solution to an optimization problem that minimizes a linear combination of data transmission power and the resulting weighted intercell interference with pricing factors at each BS and maintains the required signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINR) at user terminals. We provide a convergence analysis for the proposed distributed algorithm and derive conditions for its existence. We characterize the impact of the pricing factors in expanding the operational range of SINR targets at user terminals in a power-efficient manner. Simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm converges to a network-wide equilibrium point by balancing and stabilizing the intercell interference levels and assigning power optimal beamforming vectors to the BSs. The results also show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in closely following the performance limits of its centralized coordinated beamforming counterpart.","['Tuan Anh Le', 'Mohammad Reza Nakhai']",18,"['1fe6054c-d1c0-4bc2-8c49-4e60e69e37b0', '35b4bc60-e45e-445c-b753-036914c123af', '4bf9f0c5-8034-4323-b335-e494787d534b', '5a9dff2b-f6bf-4140-b7c6-8ed9bf4c18c0', '65a59e89-9a6a-49dc-8a85-fe7ceeb799dc', '6e5edb69-81b6-4301-83a5-b3f43a882615', '7757c456-2228-416d-955d-c7a2eaf65e7a', 'a9899422-60aa-4f28-a2b5-205415eb7b40', 'cdbfae58-1391-4796-8ad1-a9d15b394780', 'dfea9868-071b-4b47-b63e-4113fb1136fc', 'e5314e77-4d67-4071-9f4c-7fc85e2958d1', 'ee98a4cb-f46e-4de4-9f16-63aa7029dfb7']",Downlink Optimization with Interference Pricing and Statistical CSI,IEEE Transactions on Communications,2013,4abefaa6-66cf-469a-b9e4-cbec9e481dea
"Authentication watermarking schemes using block-wise watermarks for tamper localization are vulnerable to the Holliman---Memon attack. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on the Wong's localization scheme (Proceedings of the IS&T PIC, Portland) to resist this attack. A unique image index scheme is used for computing the authentication signature that is embedded in the least significant bit-plane of the block. The informed detector estimates the correct image index by using the side information about the watermarked image. The image index estimation from the fake image can definitely be an alternative to keeping a directory of image indices. So it is not necessary to manage the database of image indices for the verification purpose. The authenticity measure is defined to quantify the attack severity by taking the connectivity among possible authentic blocks into consideration. There are more blocks verified as authentic when this measure is high for a fake image constructed using this attack. As such, the blocks for a fake image can be chosen from a reduced number of database images. The blocks from any such image are to be connected with each other to maximize the authenticity measure. Thus, the attacker's task to generate a fake image of reasonable perceptual quality becomes increasingly difficult. With the proposed method there is no loss or ambiguity in localization after the Holliman---Memon attack and content tampering in an image. The localization accuracy in the proposed method is demonstrated by the simulation results and is equal to the chosen block size, similar to the Wong's scheme.","['Niladri B. Puhan', 'Anthony T. S.

"Radio equipped mobile devices have enjoyed tremendous growth in the past few years. We observe that in the near future it might be possible to build a network that routes delay-tolerant packets by harnessing user mobility and the pervasive availability of wireless devices. Such a delay-tolerant network could be used to supplement wireless infrastructure or provide service where none is available. Since mobile devices in a delay-tolerant network forward packets to nearby users, the devices can use short-range radio, which potentially reduces device power consumption and radio contention. The design of a user mobility based delay-tolerant network raises two key challenges: determining the connectivity of such a network, and determining the latency characteristics and replication requirements of routing algorithms in such a network. To determine realistic contact patterns, we collected user mobility data by conducting two user studies. We outfitted groups of students with instrumented wireless-enabled PDAs that logged pairwise contacts between study participants over a period of several weeks.

"Theproblemofsolvinga paritygameis atthecore ofmanyproblemsin modelchecking,satisfiability checking and program synthesis. Some of the best algorithms for solving parity game are strategy improvement algorithms. These are global in nature since they require the entire parity game to be present at the beginning. This is a distinct disadvantagebecause in many applications one only needs to know which winning region a particular node belongs to, an daw itnessing winning strategy may cover only a fractional part of the entire game graph. We present a local strategy improvement algorithm which explores the game graph on-the-fly whilst performing the improvement steps. We also compare it empirically with existing global strategy improvementalgorithms and the currently only other local algorithm for solving parity games. It turnsout that local strategy improvementcan outperformthese othersby severalordersof magnitude.","['Oliver Friedmann', 'Martin Lange']",8,"['1942ab4d-cbb1-4fbc-aa35-c30307c26ea9', '1c395cdd-b844-4513-8c7e-c782bfa7aaf2', '447846a6-264c-43e5-ac68-5f926fe221fe', '7058c455-a870-4b16-866e-3567269833b4', 'af99af8c-a898-486e-934c-82de92f91a9c', 'bbc3c517-d030-4c6b-80da-94555b94e286', 'f0cf781a-09a9-45c9-83d5-f2528b23777a', 'f2d7e368-8a58-4e5c-826d-fa714cc000f8']",Local Strategy Improvement for Parity Game Solving,Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science,2010,4abf171a-5495-483a-9192-dcfd324bf6bd
"Diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) has been increasingly used in imaging neuroscience over the last decade. An early form of this technique, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was rapidly implemented by major MRI scanner companies as a scanner selling point. Due to the ease of use of such implementations, and the plausibility of some of their results, DTI was leapt on by imaging neuroscientists who saw it as a powerful and unique new tool for exploring the structural connectivity of human brain. However, DTI is a rather approximate technique, and its results have frequently been given implausible interpretations that have escaped proper critique and have appeared misleadingly in journals of high reputation. In order to encourage the use of improved DW-MRI methods, which have a better chance of characterizing the actual fiber structure of white matter, and to warn against the misuse and misinterpretation of DTI, we review the physics of DW-MRI, indicate currently preferred methodology, and explain the limits of interpretation of its results. We conclude with a list of ‘Do's and Don'ts’ which define good practice in this expanding area of imaging neuroscience.","['Derek K. Jones', 'Thomas R.

"The millimeter (MM) wave and sub-MM wave (30-600 GHz) frequency band contains fundamental rotational and vibrational resonances of many molecular gases composed of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulphur. The high specificity of rotational spectra to organic molecules affords MM wave spectroscopy having potential use in remotely sensing atmospheric pollutants and the detection of airborne chemicals is important for arms control treaty verification, intelligence collection, and environmental monitoring. This paper considers the sensitivity requirements of radiofrequency receiver systems for measuring MM wave absorption/emission signatures. The significance of receiver sensitivity and material optical depth to sensing is highlighted. A background to the technology needed for sensing at MM and sub-MM wavelengths then provides the basis for a review of MM wave spectroscopy and its role on profiling the concentrations of trace polar molecules and ionized radicals in the high altitude atmosphere. The application of the MM wave spectroscopic technique in ambient conditions is then reviewed and the issues associated with developing the technique for standoff remote sensing is discussed.",['Hedley J.

"Defining the ring topology of a molecule belongs to the central and elementary problems of cheminformatics. Questions like 'How many rings does a molecule contain?' or 'In how many rings is a specific atom involved?' are based on such a definition. Obviously, the ring topology must be unique, i.e. it does not depend on atom order, chemical meaningful, and of reasonable size, at most polynomial in the number of atoms. For a long period, the smallest set of smallest rings (SSSR) was used in cheminformatics applications ignoring a very critical flaw, namely that it is not unique even for simple structures. Other definitions like the set of relevant cycles heal this flaw; however they are sometimes chemically not meaningful and can become exponential in size. Among all attempts made, none fulfils all three criteria at the same time [1].#R##N##R##N#Recently, we developed a ring definition named 'unique ring family' (URF) and a corresponding algorithm for calculating it in polynomial time [2]. URFs match the common chemical sense of a molecule's ring topology. The definition results in a unique ring description consisting of a number of ring prototypes which is at most quadratic in the number of atoms. In this talk, we will present the algorithm, benchmarks as well as several examples demonstrating the usefulness of URFs.","['Matthias Rarey', 'Adrian Kolodzik', 'Sascha Urbaczek']",0,"['d8b2e792-9791-4812-9b64-0b3dae497327', 'f78b953f-96fb-4554-af85-2086accecde5']",Let's talk about rings,Journal of Cheminformatics,2013,4abf722a-00a1-47b3-83c4-a731461feaf4
"The capillary instability of a magnetically anisotropic liquid cylinder and jets, such as Nematic liquid crystals (LC), in magnetic fields, is considered using an energy approach. The boundary problem is solved in the linear approximation of the anisotropy /spl chi//sub a/ of the magnetic susceptibility /spl chi/. The effect of the anisotropy, in the region 1 |/spl chi/|>| /spl chi//sub a/| /spl chi//sup 2/, can be strong enough to counteract and even reverse the tendency of the field to enhance stabilization by increasing the cut-off wave number k/sub s/, beyond the conventional one set by Rayleigh. It is shown that the elastic effect, which is typical of LC, is significant on the scale of nano-jets, where it prevails over the magnetic effect. The jet instability is determined by surface tension, elasticity, and magnetic permeability and anisotropy. The relative influence of the elasticity and permeability on the jet stability depends on its radius. This is particularly true on the nano-scale.","['Y. Zimmels', 'Leonid G.

"In this paper, we use information retrieval (IR) techniques to improve a speech recognition (ASR) system. The potential benefits include improved speed, accuracy, and scalability. Where conventional HMM-based speech recognition systems decode words directly, our IR-based system first decodes subword units. These are then mapped to a target word by the IR system. In this decoupled system, the IR serves as a lightweight, data-driven pronunciation model. Our proposed method is evaluated in the Windows Live Search for Mobile (WLS4M) task, and our best system has 12% fewer errors than a comparable HMM classifier. We show that even using an inexpensive IR weighting scheme (TF-IDF) yields a 3% relative error rate reduction while maintaining all of the advantages of the IR approach.","['Xiaoqiang Xiao', 'Jasha Droppo', 'Alex Acero']",50,"['0252db2f-8ba1-47a1-b115-d90cf0a1d541', '0e29615c-01ee-4776-8a92-1fc2086d5fcb', '12ce7c1f-837f-4ed6-a54d-3ff68a40d272', '3c3ce1cf-8c7a-444c-82d8-b428963784e6', '7963fb52-947c-4fd9-a657-f96a4954cf78', '89dc7280-10d5-4bdb-b631-011ca3f08ebf', '9f896d02-a4bc-4640-bc19-eaea7978980c', 'a468469e-e07e-4403-a168-269b9993e4bf', 'cba7ae06-0ee4-47e4-a759-9c49d66451c2', 'ec1aa541-c67d-4e9d-9842-dd6d5d5d8ecb']",Information retrieval methods for automatic speech recognition,"international conference on acoustics, speech, and signal processing",2010,4abf915d-19a6-46c7-ba77-04b47cc740f8
"In modern era of computing, there is a need of development in data analysis and decision making. Most of our tools are crisp, deterministic and precise in character. But general real life situations contains uncertainties. To handle such uncertainties many theories are developed such as fuzzy set, rough set, rough set on fuzzy approximation spaces etc. But all these theories have their own limitations. To overcome the limitations, the concept of soft set is introduced. But, soft set also fails if the attributes in the information system are almost identical rather exactly identical. In this paper, we propose a decision making model that consists of two processes such as preprocess and postprocess to mine decisions. In preprocess we use rough set on fuzzy approximation spaces to get the almost equivalence classes whereas in postprocess we use soft set techniques to obtain decisions. The proposed model is tested over an institutional dataset and the results show practical viability of the proposed research.","['T. K. Das', 'D. P.

"The impact of parental and peer attachment on four Internet usage motives and Internet addiction was compared using path modelling of survey data from 1,577 adolescent Malaysian school students. The model accounted for 31 percent of Internet addiction score variance. Lesser parental attachment was associated with greater Internet addiction risk. Psychological escape motives were more strongly related to Internet addiction than other motives, and had the largest mediating effect upon the parental attachment–addiction relationship. Peer attachment was unrelated to addiction risk, its main influence on Internet usage motives being encouragement of use for social interaction. It is concluded that dysfunctional parental attachment has a greater influence than peer attachment upon the likelihood of adolescents becoming addicted to Internet–related activities. It is also concluded that the need to relieve dysphoria resulting from poor adolescent–parent relationships may be a major reason for Internet addiction, and that parents’ fostering of strong bonds with their children should reduce addiction risk.","['Patrick Chin Hooi Soh', 'John P.

"Workflow analysis is indispensable to capture modeling errors in workflow designs. While several workflow analysis approaches have been defined previously, these approaches do not give precise feedback, thus making it hard for a designer to pinpoint the exact cause of modeling errors. In this paper we introduce a novel approach for analyzing and diagnosing workflows based on integer programming (IP). Each workflow model is translated into a set of IP constraints. Faulty control flow connectors can be easily detected using the approach by relaxing the corresponding constraints. We have implemented this diagnosis approach in a tool called DiagFlow which reads and diagnoses XPDL models using an existing open source IP solver as a backend. We show that the diagnosis approach is correct and illustrate it with realistic examples. Moreover, the approach is flexible and can be extended to handle a variety of new constraints, as well as to support new workflow patterns. Results of testing on large process models show that DiagFlow outperforms a state of the art tool like Woflan in terms of the solution time.","['H Rik Eshuis', 'Akhil Kumar']",50,"['230e53c0-f588-4bd9-907a-5ff5a81e506e', '25b91a52-d2a0-453b-87a7-9fe2898a8441', '29376c73-1346-422b-97a6-2be8b9124035', '29d137c4-b7c4-4f82-a806-ed999b729f4a', '36bf2189-f8d6-411c-b14b-68ff37caf03c', '3b168f6b-59e1-4468-be0e-b515a71d2413', '3cade11e-221c-4002-b9e1-74fc3b88df50', '3ef6ce48-ebe8-4b8c-994a-9a263ff326a3', '3f90b16d-05b4-4925-aa87-0e35dde4a6f6', '5c292506-d198-48a0-905f-df07da45695d', '62520056-b451-4a1e-82d2-6669908532a3', '6929a54a-0b6a-46cf-9126-d4967b1d744e', '772021ef-533a-42c3-b090-a011dc28636b', '88a0499c-91c5-4f2a-bb72-c7112f087079', 'a7ac2404-24eb-4b30-b389-748a75e35117', 'b39ab079-9982-4137-a813-10533c686c9f', 'b5e33dc5-3f87-46ff-b35e-488a24eb5b28', 'c070ded0-8264-4787-9f65-24475292409f', 'c646a17c-1144-4dca-8f83-cfd0705350bd', 'cec1c96f-74a2-49df-a101-9adc3d455f43', 'd4d387ae-62a5-4b6b-bf85-dfe631fd3440', 'd5fbc3cf-2565-47c0-a046-cf09b8fd4d84', 'd8965470-505c-4994-8498-3877aae954c7', 'e1651d51-c66d-4a05-bf89-6ba9af2a4bcf', 'e68216f1-fb70-4fe8-b0c1-4dc4150de582', 'f2845bba-bedd-4d0d-99b9-a231374694b0']",An integer programming based approach for verification and diagnosis of workflows,data and knowledge engineering,2010,4abf9958-d27f-4202-b010-36d6c3543999

"This paper describes the development and testing of a wavelet-like filter, named the SNAP, created from a neural activity simulation and used, in place of a wavelet, in a wavelet transform for improving EEG wavelet analysis, intended for brain-computer interfaces. The hypothesis is that an optimal wavelet can be approximated by deriving it from underlying components of the EEG. The SNAP was compared to standard wavelets by measuring Support Vector Machine-based EEG classification accuracy when using different wavelets/filters for EEG analysis. When classifying P300 evoked potentials, the error, as a function of the wavelet/filter used, ranged from 6.92% to 11.99%, almost twofold. Classification using the SNAP was more accurate than that with any of the six standard wavelets tested. Similarly, when differentiating between preparation for left- or right-hand movements, classification using the SNAP was more accurate (10.03% error) than for four out of five of the standard wavelets (9.54% to 12.00% error) and internationally competitive (7% error) on the 2001 NIPS competition test set.

Data mining algorithms are originally designed by assuming the data is available at one centralized site. These algorithms also assume that the whole data is fit into main memory while running the algorithm. But in today's scenario the data has to be handled is distributed even geographically. Bringing the data into a centralized site is a bottleneck in terms of the bandwidth when compared with the size of the data. In this paper for multiclass SVM we propose an algorithm which builds a global SVM model by merging the local SVMs using a distributed approach(DSVM). And the global SVM will be communicated to each site and made it available for further classification. The experimental analysis has shown promising results with better accuracy when compared with both the centralized and ensemble method. The time complexity is also reduced drastically because of the parallel construction of local SVMs. The experiments are conducted by considering the data sets of size 100s to hundred of 100s which also addresses the issue of scalability.,"['Aruna Govada', 'Bhavul Gauri', 'Sanjay Kumar Sahay']",3,"['45a652bf-a84b-4777-9a53-8391a3ea2912', '46367903-455a-4a0a-81a2-613c5eec46f6', 'a9bb2246-1ffd-4802-a236-db1c4083c57e', 'e0812f49-6956-4a3c-973a-7166e2961a99', 'ed002125-e16b-4938-ae44-c5cb9b1b8ec7', 'f011b6ee-19e8-468d-a487-05f230f8fbb1']",Distributed Multi Class SVM for Large Data Sets,"arXiv: Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing",2015,4abff35b-3905-428b-85e5-92fe56db97ba
"The use of ICTs in the public sector has long been touted for its potential to transform the institutions that govern and provide social services. The focus, however, has largely been on systems that are used within particular scales of the public sector, such as at the scale of state or national government, the scale of regional or municipal entity, or at the scale of local service providers. The work presented here takes aim at examining ICT use that crosses these scales of influence and accountability. We report on a year long ethnographic investigation conducted at a variety of social service outlets to understand how a shared information system crosses the boundaries of these very distinct organizations. We put forward that such systems are central to the work done in the public sector and represent a class of collaborative work that has gone understudied.","['Christopher A. Le Dantec', 'W.

"Middleware support for business process Management BPM has met some of the challenges with respect to encoding, performance and maintenance of workflows. A remaining challenge is complexity: business processes are becoming widely distributed, interoperating across a range of inter- and intra-organizational behaviours, vocabularies and semantics. It is important that this semantic complexity is checked and analyzed for optimality and trustworthiness prior to deployment. Petri nets are a formal method that successfully provides behavioural analysis. A shortcoming of Petri nets is that the data exchanged between business activities abstract too far away from the importance of data in actual business processes. This paper addresses this abstraction gap via additional semantic enrichment, through a two stage, model-driven approach.","['Iman Poernomo', 'Timur Umarov']",50,"['02daa3a7-0c71-4ad5-b8c8-e0eb231928c8', '3a08bfe7-d523-43fc-9f6e-9d7e1478943f', '655fc13a-d2ba-45be-9d0f-8834e6ba2423', '88695502-cea5-4e0c-95cf-bb37aa6b73fa', 'eafe9070-ec42-4439-96db-5e2cf7d3a0f7']",Business Process Development in Semantically-Enriched Environment,international conference on information technology new generations,2008,4ac0621a-7d26-49a1-a0fc-cd2357d36aa2
"We present a framework for the provision of deterministic end-to-end bandwidth guarantees in wireless ad hoc networks. Guided by a set of local feasibility conditions, multi-hop sessions are dynamically offered allocations, further translated to link demands. Using a distributed Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) protocol nodes adapt to the demand changes on their adjacent links by local, conflict-free slot reassignments. As soon as the demand changes stabilize, the nodes must incrementally converge to a TDMA schedule that realizes the global link (and session) demand allocation.We first derive sufficient local feasibility conditions for certain topology classes and show that trees can be maximally utilized.We then introduce a converging distributed link scheduling algorithm that exploits the logical tree structure that arises in several ad hoc network applications.Decoupling bandwidth allocation to multi-hop sessions from link scheduling allows support of various end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS) objectives. We focus on the max-min fairness (MMF) objective and design an end-to-end asynchronous distributed algorithm for the computation of the session MMF rates. Once the end-to-end algorithm converges, the link scheduling algorithm converges to a TDMA schedule that realizes these rates.We demonstrate the applicability of this framework through an implementation over an existing wireless technology. This implementation is free of restrictive assumptions of previous TDMA approaches: it does not require any a-priori knowledge on the number of nodes in the network nor even network-wide slot synchronization.","['Theodoros Salonidis', 'Leandros Tassiulas']",83,"['06ce54c0-2f60-4258-9bde-2d8761dcea8e', '0c840814-6118-477b-a129-6707976643cb', '10f58ff9-c14e-4bf5-9c44-0a3f14626d3f', '119e7828-689c-4c46-ac88-83a2dc51617f', '1424a3e7-42d5-4208-a84a-700290dde975', '14a274e3-6ec3-40f7-80ad-334711dc3222', '1bec0dfe-7bf6-467e-be96-46bc98d24633', '1c458029-5bab-4d15-b83b-98f2b7b87c17', '231a8de6-ac75-4eaa-b2af-46cb1a90068f', '2691e188-dd7f-4303-a25e-1cd51db0ed19', '2706e9e0-24ff-4a7b-a966-05e7341f7ca1', '283f351c-42e8-43d9-b49d-3200baed7188', '2d4e7778-a4fc-40d1-9fa8-0859b076463c', '2ec37cbd-e1ef-46bb-9fd4-6a46506f4d5b', '4faa3cea-e1f8-4948-9e3d-878bdd52f50c', '52ac2e85-250e-4d4a-b676-d9f01005c13b', '6ec614ce-4784-486c-919e-e11c152e65c7', '865d817f-2607-4082-bd9f-3298395cc316', '8fe74a2f-2bc1-4123-ae3b-957ab5f0bf8a', '9191c67f-94a4-4977-99ad-954cda004a70', '945ce7f3-ecca-4922-8bc5-611514f22f10', 'ada56e87-8486-46ea-adce-ab6c407451db', 'afc06b7c-7fb3-4f88-942b-3076ed77920e', 'b2f6fc21-3a1a-450c-9fbf-40b6d23992a8', 'bbe77fa0-4777-41b3-b750-124e58ffce9e', 'bed81d8b-9c95-4e95-9629-fb249059f83f', 'bfe1a3be-3ab8-491b-a515-de664bed8669', 'cd5a2ba1-5f11-4de8-b49b-19ab85c9087a', 'd515523f-a419-4f04-aed3-b3d909db139c', 'd632b776-d9b1-430d-b0cb-aa2aa40d1c05', 'e5989812-826a-4cac-8c3a-39f071aae1bb', 'ef4e6127-1de5-4998-a80c-571c606860a9', 'f2eae368-7d21-4399-b72e-6e7391f0482c']",Distributed dynamic scheduling for end-to-end rate guarantees in wireless ad hoc networks,mobile ad hoc networking and computing,2005,4ac085c8-8441-4f86-a027-0bfdf0a9ad08

"This paper presents an experimental study of dynamic load balancing methods for a parallelized solution to a well-known problem in computational molecular biology: computing the accessible surface areas (ASA) of proteins. The main contribution is a better understanding of how certain techniques for load estimation and redistribution must be combined carefully for effectiveness and how these combinations need to change during the course of a computation. In particular, the Shrake-Rupley ASA algorithm is implemented and three aspects of dynamic load balancing are studied: how to estimate load imbalance (the estimation problem); when to invoke load redistribution (the invocation problem); and how to load balance (the mapping problem). The results in this paper show that a dynamically-selected mix of algorithms in each category that adapts to changing structure within the protein works better than a static periodic application of a static mix of algorithms.","['Edward Suh', 'Bhagirath Narahari', 'Rahul Simha']",2,"['04a612fc-7ffc-4f13-99c1-5d309fd9cf91', '25b6804e-66f5-44f8-a65d-ac8710743979', '54f035d7-121f-47f8-9f1c-78cb32fb625c', '772dd68e-650f-4bdd-be2e-a88b2c8d1183', 'a1f93869-b5c9-4385-86b7-b8a05e18e2e5']",Dynamic load balancing schemes for computing accessible surface area of protein molecules,ieee international conference on high performance computing data and analytics,1998,4ac0e68d-1497-4ac5-97b4-d3d23626f095

Considering aircraft flowing through a fixed control volume, new air traffic control models and scenarios are defined that enable the study of long-term aircraft flow stability. For a class of two intersecting aircraft flows, this paper considers conflict scenarios involving arbitrary encounter angles. It is shown that aircraft flow stability, defined both in terms of safety and performance, is preserved under the decentralized conflict resolution algorithm considered. It is shown that the lateral deviations experienced by aircraft in each flow are bounded.","['Zhi-Hong Mao', 'Eric Feron', 'Karl D.

"Abstract#R##N##R##N#Life forms must organize information into cognitive models reflecting the outside environment, and in a complex and changing environment a life form must constantly select and organize this mass of information to avoid slipping into a chaotic cognitive state. The task of developing and maintaining adaptive cognitive models can be understood through two processes, crucial to regulating the interconnections between environmental elements. The inclusion and exclusion of information follows a process designated by P and the process by which cognitive models change is designated by K. Higher order concepts are created by reducing the interconnections between elements to a minimal number to avoid cognitive chaos. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Complexity 9:31–37, 2004",['Robert M.

"In this work, we propose a general method for computing distance between video frames or sequences. Unlike conventional appearance-based methods, we first extract motion fields from original videos. To avoid the huge memory requirement demanded by the previous approaches, we utilize the “bag of motion vectors” model, and select Gaussian mixture model as compact representation. Thus, estimating distance between two frames is equivalent to calculating the distance between their corresponding Gaussian mixture models, which is solved via earth mover distance (EMD) in this paper. On the basis of the inter-frame distance, we further develop the distance measures for both full video sequences.#R##N##R##N#Our main contribution is four-fold. Firstly, we operate on a tangent vector field of spatio-temporal 2D surface manifold generated by video motions, rather than the intensity gradient space. Here we argue that the former space is more fundamental. Secondly, the correlations between frames are explicitly exploited using a generative model named dynamic conditional random fields (DCRF). Under this framework, motion fields are estimated by Markov volumetric regression, which is more robust and may avoid the rank deficiency problem. Thirdly, our definition for video distance is in accord with human intuition and makes a better tradeoff between frame dissimilarity and chronological ordering. Lastly, our definition for frame distance allows for partial distance.","['Yadong Mu', 'Shuicheng Yan', 'Thomas S.

"This paper investigates the use of an infinity norm in formulating the optimization measures for computing the inverse kinematics of redundant arms. The infinity norm of a vector is its maximum absolute value component and hence its minimization implies the determination of a minimum effort solution as opposed to the minimum-energy criterion associated with the Euclidean norm. In applications where individual magnitudes of the vector components are of concern, this norm represents the physical requirements more closely than does the Euclidean norm. We first study the minimization of the infinity-norm of the joint velocity vector itself, and discuss its physical interpretation. Next, a new method of optimizing a subtask criterion, defined using the infinity-norm, to perform additional tasks such as obstacle avoidance or joint limit avoidance is introduced. Simulations illustrating these methods and comparing the results with the Euclidean norm solutions are presented.","['Arati S. Deo', 'Ian D.

"Cable-driven parallel manipulators (CDPMs) are a special class of parallel manipulators that are driven by cables instead of rigid links. Due to the unilateral property of the cables, all the driving cables in a fully-constrained CDPM must always maintain positive tension. As a result, tension analysis is the most essential issue for these CDPMs. By drawing upon the mathematical theory from convex analysis, a sufficient and necessary tension-closure condition is proposed in this paper. The key point of this tension-closure condition is to construct a critical vector that must be positively expressed by the tension vectors associated with the driving cables. It has been verified that such a tension-closure condition is general enough to cater for CDPMs with different numbers of cables and DOFs. Using the tension-closure condition, a computationally efficient algorithm is developed for the tension-closure pose analysis of CDPMs, in which only a limited set of deterministic linear equation systems need to be resolved. This algorithm has been employed for the tension-closure workspace analysis of CDPMs and verified by a number of computational examples. The computational time required by the proposed algorithm is always shorter as compared to other existing algorithms.","['Weikang Lim', 'Guilin Yang', 'Song Huat Yeo', 'Shabbir Kurbanhusen Mustafa', 'I.M.

"We describe an algorithm for support vector machines (SVM) that can be parallelized efficiently and scales to very large problems with hundreds of thousands of training vectors. Instead of analyzing the whole training set in one optimization step, the data are split into subsets and optimized separately with multiple SVMs. The partial results are combined and filtered again in a 'Cascade' of SVMs, until the global optimum is reached. The Cascade SVM can be spread over multiple processors with minimal communication overhead and requires far less memory, since the kernel matrices are much smaller than for a regular SVM. Convergence to the global optimum is guaranteed with multiple passes through the Cascade, but already a single pass provides good generalization. A single pass is 5x - 10x faster than a regular SVM for problems of 100,000 vectors when implemented on a single processor. Parallel implementations on a cluster of 16 processors were tested with over 1 million vectors (2-class problems), converging in a day or two, while a regular SVM never converged in over a week.","['Hans Peter Graf', 'Eric Cosatto', 'Léon Bottou', 'Igor Dourdanovic', 'Vladimir Vapnik']",389,"['5ffac6f9-2456-42cf-830c-9049ce37c899', '62919d32-6537-457a-b309-38af4ef51e64', 'b82a8c11-7ce6-442f-955e-9dbf49317cb8', 'd6104d9a-faaa-4db4-8c4e-748176157ef2', 'dca87800-3c47-4fc8-9fdf-a8f6faa3191d', 'f006e236-59ad-4647-a59f-4f46dc2c85be']",Parallel Support Vector Machines: The Cascade SVM,neural information processing systems,2005,4ac215da-bb39-445c-9759-ebdb3faf472e
"Direct inference of heart-surface potentials from body-surface potentials has been the goal of most recent work on electrocardiographic inverse solutions. We developed and tested indirect methods for inferring heart-surface potentials based on estimation of regularized multipole sources. Regularization was done using Tikhonov, constrained-least-squares, and multipole-truncation techniques. These multipole-equivalent methods (MEMs) were compared to the conventional mixed boundary-value method (BVM) in a realistic torso model with up to 20% noise added to body-surface potentials and /spl plusmn/1 cm error in heart position and size. Optimal regularization was used for all inverse solutions. The relative error of inferred heart-surface potentials of the MEM was significantly less (p<0.05) than that of the BVM using zeroth-order Tikhonov regularization in 10 of the 12 cases tested. These improvements occurred with a fourth-degree (24 coefficients) or smaller multipole moment. From these multipole coefficients, heart-surface potentials can be found at an unlimited number of heart-surface locations. Our indirect methods for estimating heart-surface potentials based on multipole inference appear to offer significant improvement over the conventional direct approach.","['Daryl G. Beetner', 'R.M.

"In this article, we propose a novel method to derive exact closed-form ergodic capacity and outage probability expressions for correlated Rayleigh fading channels with receive diversity. Unlike the existing works, the proposed method employ a simple approach for the capacity and outage analysis for receiver diversity channels operating at different signal-to-noise ratios depicted in the diagonal elements of matrix Ω. With x being the channel gain vector, random variable of the form Y(a)=a + x∗Ω x is considered. Novelty of the work resides in the fact that the distribution of Y(a) is accurately determined by employing Fourier representation of unit step function followed by complex integration in a straight forward way.

"Variable selection methods are routinely applied in regression modeling to identify a small number of descriptors which ""best"" explain the variation in the response variable. Most statistical packages that perform regression have some form of stepping algorithm that can be used in this identification process. Unfortunately, when a subset of p variables measured on a sample of n objects are selected from a set of k(>p) to maximize the squared sample multiple regression coefficient, the significance of the resulting regression is upwardly biased. The extent of this bias is investigated by using Monte Carlo simulation and is presented as an inflation factor which when multiplied by the usual tabulated F ratio gives an estimate of the true 5% critical value. The results show that selection bias can be very high even for moderate-size data sets. Selecting three variables from 50 generated at random with 20 observations will almost certainly provide a significant result if the usual tabulated F values are used. An interpolation formula is provided for the calculation of the inflation factor for different combinations of (n, p, k). Four real data sets are examined to illustrate the effect of correlated descriptor variables on the degree of inflation.","['David W. Salt', 'Subhash Ajmani', 'Ray Crichton', 'David J.

First, we map the input data into m different feature spaces by m empirical kernels, where each generated feature space is taken as one view of the input space.

"In the recent years, the peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay network has been a promising architecture for multimedia streaming services besides its common use for efficient file sharing. By simply increasing the number of peers, the P2P overlay network can meet the high bit rate requirements of multimedia applications. Optimal peer selection for newly joining peers is one of the important problems, especially in wireless networks which have limited resources and capacity, since the peer selection process has a direct impact on the throughput of the underlay network and the co-existing unicast traffic. In this paper we tackle the problem of peer selection for streaming applications over wireless ad hoc networks. We devise a novel peer selection algorithm which maximizes the throughput of the underlay network, and at the same time makes P2P streaming friendly towards the co-existing data traffic. The proposed receiver based rate allocation and peer selection (RPS) algorithm is derived using the network utility maximization (NUM) framework. The algorithm solves the peer selection and rate allocation problem distributedly while optimally adapting the medium access control (MAC) layer parameters and is easily extensible to large P2P networks. Simulation results show that by using the proper price exchange mechanism, the peer receivers can effectively maximize the throughput of the underlay network by intelligently selecting its source peers.","['Eren Gürses', 'Anna N.

"High-frequency chest compression (HFCC) can be used as a therapeutic intervention to assist in the transport and clearance of mucus and enhance water secretion for cystic fibrosis patients. An HFCC pump-vest and half chest-lung simulation, with 23 lung generations, has been developed using inertance, compliance, viscous friction relationships, and Newton's second law. The simulation has proven to be useful in studying the effects of parameter variations and nonlinear effects on HFCC system performance and pulmonary system response. The simulation also reveals HFCC waveform structure and intensity changes in various segments of the pulmonary system. The HFCC system simulation results agree with measurements, indicating that the HFCC energy transport mechanism involves a mechanically induced pulsation or vibration waveform with average velocities in the lung that are dependent upon small air displacements over large areas associated with the vest-chest interface. In combination with information from lung physiology, autopsies and a variety of other lung modeling efforts, the results of the simulation can reveal a number of therapeutic implications.","[""George D.

"Large-scale traffic networks can be modeled as graphs in which a set of nodes are connected through a set of links that cannot be loaded above their traffic capacities. Traffic flows may vary over time. Then the nodes may be requested to modify the traffic flows to be sent to their neighboring nodes. In this case, a dynamic routing problem arises. The decision makers are realistically assumed 1) to generate their routing decisions on the basis of local information and possibly of some data received from other nodes, typically, the neighboring ones and 2) to cooperate on the accomplishment of a common goal, that is, the minimization of the total traffic cost. Therefore, they can be regarded as the cooperating members of informationally distributed organizations, which, in control engineering and economics, are called team organizations. Team optimal control problems cannot be solved analytically unless special assumptions on the team model are verified. In general, this is not the case with traffic networks. An approximate resolutive method is then proposed, in which each decision maker is assigned a fixed-structure routing function where some parameters have to be optimized. Among the various possible fixed-structure functions, feedforward neural networks have been chosen for their powerful approximation capabilities. The routing functions can also be computed (or adapted) locally at each node. Concerning traffic networks, we focus attention on store-and-forward packet switching networks, which exhibit the essential peculiarities and difficulties of other traffic networks. Simulations performed on complex communication networks point out the effectiveness of the proposed method.","['Marco Baglietto', 'Thomas Parisini', 'R.

"This paper studies the $L^2$ (mean-square) optimal design of discrete-time FIR estimators. A solution procedure, which reduces the problem to a static matrix optimization problem admitting a closed-form solution, is proposed. In the latter solution, a special state-space structure of the associated matrices is exploited to obtain efficient formulae with the computational complexity proportional to the length of the impulse response of the estimator. Unlike previously available least-square FIR results, our treatment does not impose unnecessarily restrictive assumptions on the process dynamics and can handle interpolation constraints on the unit circle, which facilitates the inclusion of steady-state performance requirements.","['Yaron Levinson', 'Leonid Mirkin']",3,,$L^2$ Optimization in Discrete FIR Estimation: Exploiting State-Space Structure,Siam Journal on Control and Optimization,2013,4ac3763b-5f2c-47db-a580-4364d9639bc4
The authors utilized the concept of a compact antenna range to obtain plane-wave illumination to accurately measure scattering properties of simulated sea ice. They also made simultaneous measurements using conventional antennas. Measured scattering coefficients obtained with the plane-wave system at 10 GHz decreased by about 35 dB when the incidence angle increased from 0/spl deg/ to 10/spl deg/. Scattering coefficients derived from data collected with the radar system at 13.5 GHz using conventional far-field antennas decreased by about 20 dB over the same angular region. This demonstrates that the far-field properties of a widebeam antenna are inadequate for measuring the angular scattering response of smooth surfaces. They believe that application of the compact antenna range concept for scattering measurements has a wide range of applications and is the solution to the long-standing problem of how to directly measure scattering consisting of coherent and incoherent components. >,"['Sivaprasad Gogineni', 'Kenneth C.

"In this paper, we describe a novel 3D subdivision strategy to extract the surface of binary image data. This iterative approach generates a series of surface meshes that capture different levels of detail of the underlying structure. At the highest level of detail, the resulting surface mesh generated by our approach uses only about 10 percent of the triangles in comparison to the Marching Cube (MC) algorithm, even in settings where almost no image noise is present. Our approach also eliminates the so-called ""staircase effect,"" which voxel-based algorithms like the MC are likely to show, particularly if nonuniformly sampled images are processed. Finally, we show how the presented algorithm can be parallelized by subdividing 3D image space into rectilinear blocks of subimages. As the algorithm scales very well with an increasing number of processors in a multithreaded setting, this approach is suited to process large image data sets of several gigabytes. Although the presented work is still computationally more expensive than simple voxel-based algorithms, it produces fewer surface triangles while capturing the same level of detail, is more robust toward image noise, and eliminates the above-mentioned ""staircase"" effect in anisotropic settings. These properties make it particularly useful for biomedical applications, where these conditions are often encountered.","['Y.

"Summary form only given. Future automotive security systems will benefit from visual scene analysis based on a fusion of video, infrared, and radar images. Today we have already functions like lane departure warning and automatic cruise control (ACC) for pretty well defined driving environments, such as highways and primary roads. Recent research activities concentrate on more complex environments, such as city traffic with a wide variety of traffic participants moving in an unpredictable manner, e.g. bikes, pedestrians, children, and even animals, and under changing weather and lighting conditions. The ITRS semiconductor roadmap for microelectronics forecasts a continued doubling of transistor capacity per chip every 2 to 2.5 years enabling billion transistor ASIC designs in the near future. Multi processor system on chip (MPSoC) solutions with 8, 16 or even more standard RISC CPU cores, mega-bytes of fast (ns access latencies) on-chip SRAM memories, giga-byte per second interconnect buses or NoC (network on chip) meshes, high-speed serial I/Os and, last but not least, million gate equivalent dedicated hardware accelerator functions in eFPGA (embedded field programmable gate array) logic are becoming reality on a single silicon substrate. Examples of current research projects shall illustrate our perception on how this tremendous increase in functionality and computational performance per chip area may impact automotive control unit (ACU) architectures for driver assistance applications. The AutoVision processor is a dynamically reconfigurable MPSoC prototype where video-specific pixel processing engines are on-the-fly loaded or exchanged without interrupting regular system operations. For the time being, pixel processing engines cover functions such as object edge detection or luminance segmentation, and are implemented as dedicated hardware accelerators to ensure real-time frame processing capabilities of the AutoVision processor. Dynamic replacement of processing engines ensures an automatic and area efficient adaptation to various driving conditions. Segmented objects are, in a subsequent step, characterized by means of standard MPEG-7 descriptors and entered as search criteria into traffic scene analysis databases. Goal is to obtain a clean distinction between passenger cars, trucks, and big rectangular traffic signs, and to identify pedestrians or bikers in complex traffic situations.

"Many practical applications are related to frequent sequential pattern mining, ranging from Web Usage Mining to Bioinformatics. To ensure an appropriate extraction cost for useful mining tasks, a key issue is to push the user-defined constraints deep inside the mining algorithms. In this paper, we study the search for frequent sequential patterns that are also similar to an user-defined reference pattern.

"Electron tomography provides opportunities to determine three-dimensional cellular architecture at resolutions high enough to identify individual macromolecules such as proteins. Image analysis of such data poses a challenging problem due to the extremely low signal-to-noise ratios that makes individual volumes simply too noisy to allow reliable structural interpretation. This requires using averaging techniques to boost the signal-to-noise ratios, a common practice in electron microscopy single particle analysis where they have proven to be very powerful in elucidating high resolution structure. Although there are significant similarities in the way data is processed, several new problems arise in the tomography case that have to be properly dealt with. Such problems involve dealing with the missing wedge characteristic of limited angle tomography, the need for robust and efficient 3D alignment routines, and design of methods that account for diverse conformations through the use of classification. We present a framework for reconstruction via alignment, classification and averaging of volumes obtained from limited angle electron tomography, providing a powerful tool for high resolution structure determination and description of conformational variability in a biological context","['Alberto Bartesaghi', 'Pablo Sprechmann', 'Gregory Randall', 'Guillermo Sapiro', 'Sriram Subramaniam']",0,[],"CLASSIFICATION, AVERAGING AND RECONSTRUCTION OF MACROMOLECULES IN ELECTRON TOMOGRAPHY",international symposium on biomedical imaging,2007,4ac4930f-2fd5-4534-b63d-dffbd7b9839f
"Recently, the augmented complex LMS (ACLMS) algorithm has been proposed for modeling complex-valued signal relationships in which a widely-linear model can be more appropriate [1]. It is not clear, however, how the behavior of ACLMS differs from that of the conventional complex LMS (CCLMS) algorithm. In this paper, we leverage a recently-developed analysis for the complex LMS algorithm [2] to illuminate the performance relationships between the ACLMS and CCLMS algorithms. Our analysis shows that the ACLMS algorithm can potentially achieve a lower steady-state mean-squared error as compared to that of CCLMS, but the convergence speed of ACLMS is slowed in the presence of highly non-circular complex-valued input signals. An adaptive beamforming example indicates the utility of the results.","['Scott C. Douglas', 'Danilo P.

"Extending the lifetime is a key issue in wireless sensor networks. An effective way to extend the lifetime is to partition the sensors into several covers and activate the covers one by one. Thus, the more the covers, the longer the lifetime. To find the maximum number of covers has been modeled as the Set K-Cover problem. In this paper we propose using order-based genetic algorithm to solve the Set K-Cover problem for extending the lifetime of wireless sensor networks. The proposed algorithm needs neither an upper bound nor any assumption about the maximum number of covers. Experimental results show that the order-based genetic algorithm can achieve near-optimal solutions efficiently.","['Chien-Chih Liao', 'Chuan-Kang Ting']",2,"['3b93c8d8-9c71-4ce7-ac0d-8119784f9f1b', '4c07474f-5254-45c3-84d2-86c0480c3cb9', 'a5f0e7be-a809-4056-87b6-f7db6301f0a5', 'cfdce0c8-e269-4ab7-b4c4-abe80fac2a3b', 'dbc996b4-e926-40e8-8636-487a30b72555', 'ec548c2b-0490-43a8-8896-54a90b144e88', 'f3267c01-b670-4b7a-a3a5-79088c0d90ab', 'f699578c-c859-4e95-9e8c-5a56629a3a09']",Extending wireless sensor network lifetime through order-based genetic algorithm,"systems, man and cybernetics",2008,4ac4a399-bdf2-491e-ae2d-b5b205bb62cc
"A robust neural predictor is designed for noisy chaotic time series prediction in this paper. The main idea is based on the consideration of the bounded uncertainty in predictor input, and it is a typical Errors-in-Variables problem. The robust design is based on the linear-in-parameters ESN (Echo State Network) model. By minimizing the worst-case residual induced by the bounded perturbations in the echo state variables, the robust predictor is obtained in coping with the uncertainty in the noisy time series. In the experiment, the classical Mackey-Glass 84-step benchmark prediction task is investigated. The prediction performance is studied for the nominal and robust design of ESN predictors.","['Min Han', 'Xinying Wang']",50,"['1dd9b2a2-4d21-4247-b9a3-0c289562023b', '4d4e9cdf-0544-42ac-b1b4-85bfd7b0a688', '91f40e40-282e-4443-8265-c8fa32655394', '96842eab-df54-4f56-8ee1-cc69ffa3f31e', 'd717a8a3-2073-4d33-bae4-c5e7b95e5c9e', 'dd53c9ed-6cb1-44a7-bdc6-b5eea960180a', 'ff3640bb-ce56-4e99-9c40-1c7daba5447d']",Robust neural predictor for noisy chaotic time series prediction,international symposium on neural networks,2013,4ac4bcfb-398e-44cd-9e84-5b1fc3b0aadb
"Maximally parallel multiset rewriting systems (MPMRS) give a convenient way to express relations between unstructured objects. The functioning of various computational devices may be expressed in terms of MPMRS (e.g., register machines and many variants of P systems). In particular, this means that MPMRS are Turing universal; however, a direct translation leads to quite a large number of rules. Like for other classes of computationally complete devices, there is a challenge to find a universal system having the smallest number of rules. In this article we present different rule minimization strategies for MPMRS based on encodings and structural transformations. We apply these strategies to the translation of a small universal register machine (Korec (1996) [9]) and we show that there exists a universal MPMRS with 23 rules. Since MPMRS are identical to a restricted variant of P systems with antiport rules, the results we obtained improve previously known results on the number of rules for those systems.","['Artiom Alhazov', 'Sergey Verlan']",50,"['2d134161-9023-4005-bc6e-4f354a980dc3', '76b93d54-d2ab-49d9-9259-90b90cf8fc19', '9bcfbf74-8e57-4b4e-8c46-ba9cada2df45', 'b215f194-a0ce-4699-9d46-69ad938c6c4d', 'd189b2e0-affe-482d-9639-6f566cdb538f', 'd2a25801-40cd-4f99-8d96-8da6897609e6', 'ee9d9adc-3d42-4693-a21b-29cb3e38ff87']",Minimization strategies for maximally parallel multiset rewriting systems,Theoretical Computer Science,2011,4ac4bf11-1101-4ee4-9245-c0ae6ac8bde1
"The OSCAR [14] cluster installation toolkit was created by the Open Cluster Group (OCG) for one particular type of High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster. OSCAR is currently one of the widely used cluster installation toolkits; it boasts hundreds of thousands of downloads and active mailing lists. OSCAR has expanded its area with several sub-projects targeting other types of HPC clusters. Each of these projects share a core set of OSCAR code, including the OSCAR Database and its access API, ""ODA"" (OSCAR Database API). The ODA abstraction layer, consisting of a database schema and corresponding API, hides a commodity back-end database (e.g., MySQL [15]). Because OSCAR and its sub-projects are targeted at new, innovative environments (including non-HPC environments), there are significant issues with managing various configurations of each project. For example, as we previously showed [8], previous versions of ODA were unable to represent the complex, ever-growing set of data required to accurately describe the clusters that it manages. Further, its API was extremely complex, requiring a steep learning curve for OSCAR developers. Therefore, we have designed and implemented a new database schema to deal with these issues. This new version of ODA has not only resolved the above problems but also, as proposed in our previous paper, enabled storage and retrieval of various configuration information, and encouraged data re-use between the main OSCAR project and its derivative projects. In addition, the new version of ODA has sped up the OSCAR installation process. This document presents a simpler, highly flexible design and implementation of ODA slated to be included in OSCAR v5.0. It also suggests a blueprint for maintaining the database modules of ODA in a systematic, organized way.","['DongInn Kim', 'Jeffrey M.

"Abstract A bounded socio-technical experiment (BSTE) attempts to introduce a new technology, service, or a social arrangement on a small scale. Many such experiments in personal mobility are ongoing worldwide. They are carried out by coalitions of diverse actors, and are driven by long term and large scale visions of advancing society’s sustainability agenda. This paper focuses on the processes of higher-order learning that occur through BSTEs. Based on the conceptual frameworks from theories of organizational learning, policy-oriented learning, and diffusion of innovation, we identify two types of learning: the first type occurs among the participants in the experiment and their immediate professional networks; the second type occurs in the society at large. Both types play a key role in the societal transition towards sustainable mobility systems. Two case studies, in which the Design for Sustainability Group at Technical University of Delft has participated, provide empirical data for the analysis.

"During a complete running stride, which involves significant periods of flight during which no legs are contacting the ground, a quadruped cannot employ static stability techniques. Instead, the corrective forces necessary to maintain dynamic stability must be applied during the short stance intervals inherent to high-speed running. Because of this complexity and the large coupled forces required to run, much of the research on the control of quadruped running has focused on planar systems which are not required to simultaneously control attitude in all three dimensions. The 3D trot controller presented here overcomes these and other complexities to control a trot up to 3.75 m/s, approximately 3 body lengths per second, and turning rates up to 20 deg/s. The biomimetic method of banking into a high-speed turn is also investigated here. Along with the details of the attitude control algorithm, a set of control principles for high-speed legged motion is presented. These principles, such as the need to counteract the disturbance of swing leg return and the usefulness of force redistribution during stance, are not dependent on a particular scale or actuation scheme and can be applied to a wider range of legged systems.","['Luther R.

"An integration of a fuzzy controller and modified Elman neural networks (NN) approximation-based computed-torque controller is proposed for motion control of autonomous manipulators in dynamic and partially known environments containing moving obstacles. The navigation technique of robot control using artificial potential fields is based on the fuzzy controller. The NN controller can deal with unmodeled bounded disturbances and or unstructured unmodeled dynamics of the robot arm. The NN weights are tuned online, with no off-line learning phase required. The stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed by the Lyapunov theory. The purpose of the controller, which is designed as a neuro-fuzzy controller, is to generate the commands for the servo-systems of the robot so it may choose its way to its goal autonomously, while reacting in real-time to unexpected events. The proposed scheme has been successfully tested. The controller also demonstrates remarkable performance in adaptation to changes in manipulator dynamics. Sensor-based motion control is an essential feature for dealing with model uncertainties and unexpected obstacles in real-time world systems.","['Jean Bosco Mbede', 'Xinhan Huang', 'Min Wang']",50,"['0c4e2e3d-5038-4619-9922-0a4625c60985', '30932642-fd17-4ae9-9a5b-90e67adcfe41', '44b2ff38-4552-4e3e-bc32-4383eb3cfd80', '50957155-60c1-4c7d-abe6-01db7073deba', '919c4ef5-dfb1-4059-908f-af1102873a2b', 'b862388a-6d62-493f-90ca-83fe416dd883', 'c4998229-c238-4ef5-8fdc-91974ac13330', 'c5571a17-ce09-4db8-b163-23526965df18', 'c826b377-0804-45f7-8166-6738385c2681', 'e07c17af-995e-477a-9808-cb8ef7f8d7e1']",Robust fuzzy and recurrent neural network motion control among dynamic obstacles for robot manipulators,international conference on robotics and automation,2000,4ac51b4a-4af7-4c6d-a9fd-eb216a9941ed

"This paper introduces multi-scale tree-based approaches to image segmentation, using Rissanen's coding theoretic minimum description length (MDL) principle to penalize overly complex segmentations. Images are modelled as Gaussian random fields of independent pixels, with piecewise constant mean and variance. This model captures variations in both intensity (mean value) and texture (variance). Segmentation thus amounts to detecting changes in the mean and/or variance. One algorithm is based on an adaptive (greedy) rectangular recursive partitioning scheme. The second algorithm is an optimally pruned ""wedgelet"" decorated dyadic partitioning. We compare the two schemes with an alternative constant variance dyadic CART (classification and regression tree) scheme which accounts only for variations in mean, and demonstrate their performance on SAR images.","['Unoma Ndili', 'Robert D.

"Motivation: Genetic networks are often described statistically using graphical models (e.g. Bayesian networks). However, inferring the network structure offers a serious challenge in microarray analysis where the sample size is small compared to the number of considered genes. This renders many standard algorithms for graphical models inapplicable, and inferring genetic networks an 'ill-posed' inverse problem.#R##N##R##N#Methods: We introduce a novel framework for small-sample inference of graphical models from gene expression data. Specifically, we focus on the so-called graphical Gaussian models (GGMs) that are now frequently used to describe gene association networks and to detect conditionally dependent genes. Our new approach is based on (1) improved (regularized) small-sample point estimates of partial correlation, (2) an exact test of edge inclusion with adaptive estimation of the degree of freedom and (3) a heuristic network search based on false discovery rate multiple testing. Steps (2) and (3) correspond to an empirical Bayes estimate of the network topology.#R##N##R##N#Results: Using computer simulations, we investigate the sensitivity (power) and specificity (true negative rate) of the proposed framework to estimate GGMs from microarray data. This shows that it is possible to recover the true network topology with high accuracy even for small-sample datasets. Subsequently, we analyze gene expression data from a breast cancer tumor study and illustrate our approach by inferring a corresponding large-scale gene association network for 3883 genes.#R##N##R##N#Availability: The authors have implemented the approach in the R package 'GeneTS' that is freely available from http://www.stat.uni-muenchen.de/~strimmer/genets/, from the R archive (CRAN) and from the Bioconductor website.#R##N##R##N#Contact: korbinian.strimmer@lmu.de","['Juliane Schäfer', 'Korbinian Strimmer']",699,"['001c9bd3-bdf7-461e-9326-426c4ce11cdc', '0ca77ada-af26-4943-b6ff-e19d9521e1b2', '0f115eea-2272-431f-9f21-6d6789b2bbc9', '46510028-2e6e-4ac6-a306-b63fdac85019', '4a2a1673-ff93-4125-886d-6c681e5d4a3c', '4fb09af9-2864-4012-b8e3-3be84094308f', '5065549e-055c-4dac-aa54-1644ddc622a4', '94a668a8-1dba-476f-bd82-f89fc13ad83d', 'a401c4a8-ed5c-457d-aca8-2c9e971bb959', 'a6df993d-4806-4884-b249-96b0d3db308f', 'a9ee482e-8f68-406b-b41a-2084d611450c', 'abad0cf5-6b84-4c40-91a2-f6ca3ad7fbc1', 'be2fb2ad-26d1-4435-84c2-d9ac8709f10a', 'cd5b228e-f497-47b6-8214-b405f39fe704', 'e1f0b559-09c7-4370-99db-7eeebc1dc17e', 'f2786853-587d-4d4f-8816-212fecbf3019', 'f72f5ad1-04cd-4229-a9e3-b1ebb577a387']",An empirical Bayes approach to inferring large-scale gene association networks,Bioinformatics,2005,4ac544ae-6e06-4f9f-a513-d2bb82255b78
"The authors develop a general methodology to analyze crosstalk effects that are likely to cause errors in deep submicron high-speed circuits. They focus on crosstalk due to capacitive coupling between a pair of lines. Closed form equations are derived that quantify the severity of these effects and describe qualitatively the dependence of these effects on the values of circuit parameters, the rise/fall times of the input transitions, and the skew between the transitions. For noise propagation, they present a new way for predicting the output waveform produced by an inverter due to a nonsquare wave pulse at its input. To expedite the computation of the response of a logic gate to an input pulse, the authors have developed a novel way of modeling such gates by an equivalent inverter.

"ASIC provides more than an order of magnitude advantage in terms of density, speed, and power requirement per gate. However, economic (cost of masks) and technological (deep micron manufacturability) trends favor FPGA as an implementation platform. In order to combine the advantages of both platforms and alleviate their disadvantages, recently a number of approaches, such as structured ASIC/regular fabrics, have been proposed. Our goal is to introduce an approach that has the same objective, but is orthogonal to those already proposed. The idea is to implement several ASIC designs in such a way that they share the datapath, memory structure, and several bottom layers of interconnect, while each design has only a few unique metal layers. We identified and addressed two main problems in our quest to develop a CAD flow for realization of such designs. They are: (i) the creation of the datapath, and (ii) the identification of common and unique interconnects for each design. Both problems are solved optimally using ILP formulations. We assembled a design flow platform using two new programs and the Trimaran and Shade tools. We quantitatively analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of the approach using the Mediabench benchmark suite.","['Jennifer L.

"We consider approximation algorithms for buy-at-bulk network design, with the additional constraint that demand pairs be protected against edge or node failures in the network. In practice, the most popular model used in high speed telecommunication networks for protection against failures, is the so-called 1+1 model. In this model, two edge or node-disjoint paths are provisioned for each demand pair. We obtain the first non-trivial approximation algorithms for buy-at-bulk network design in the 1+1 model for both edge and node-disjoint protection requirements. Our results are for the single-cable cost model, which is prevalent in optical networks. More specifically, we present a constant-factor approximation for the single-sink case, and an O(log 3  n) approximation for the multi-commodity case.

"The Fisher kernel is a generic framework which combines the benefits of generative and discriminative approaches to pattern classification. In this contribution, we propose to apply this framework to handwritten word-spotting. Given a word image and a keyword generative model, the idea is to generate a vector which describes how the parameters of the keyword model should be modified to best fit the word image.This vector can then be used as the input of a discriminative classifier. We compare the performance of the proposed approach with that of a generative baseline on a challenging real-world dataset of customer letters. When the kernel used by the classifier is linear, the performance improvement is marginal but the proposed system is approximately 15 times faster than the baseline. If we use a non-linear kernel devised for this task, we obtain a 15\% relative reduction of the error but the detector is approximately 15 times slower.","['Florent Perronnin', 'Jose A.

This paper proposes four methods for improving the performance of keyword spotting (KWS) systems. Keyword models are usually created by concatenating the phoneme HMMs and garbage models consist of all phonemes HMMs. We present the results of investigations involving the use of skips in states of keyword HMMs and we focus on improving the hit ratio; then for false alarm reduction in KWS we model the words that are similar to keywords and we create HMMs for highly frequent words. These models help to improve the performance of the filler model. Two post-processing steps based on phoneme and word probabilities are used on the results of KWS to reduce the false alarms. We evaluate the performance of the improved keyword spotting in FarsDat corpus and compare the approaches.

"New technologies for manufacturing 3D Stacked ICs offer numerous opportunities for the design of complex and effcient embedded systems. But these technologies also introduce many design options at system/chip design level, hard to grasp during the complete design cycle. Because of the sequential nature of current design practices, designers are often forced to introduce design margins to meet required specications, resulting in sub-optimal designs. In this paper we introduce new design methodology and practical tool chain, called PathFinding Flow, that can help designers to easily trade-off between different system level design choices, physical design and/or technology options and understand their impact on typical design parameters such as cost, performance and power. Proposed methodology and the tool chain will be demonstrated on a practical case study, involving fairly complex Multi-Processor System-on-Chip using Network-on-Chip for communication medium. With this example we will show how High-Level Synthesis can be used to quickly move from high-level to RTL models, necessary for accurate physical prototyping for both computation and communication. We will also show how the possibility of design iteration, through the mechanism of feedback based on physical information from physical prototyping, can improve design performance. Finally, we will show how we can move in no time from traditional 2D to 3D design and how we can measure benets of such design choice.","['Dragomir Milojevic', 'Trevor E. Carlson', 'K.

"In this paper, an approach to design information systems for traceability is proposed. The paper applies gozinto graph modelling for traceability of the goods flow. A gozinto graph represents a graphical listing of raw materials, parts, intermediates and subassemblies, which a process transforms into an end product, through a sequence of operations. Next, the graphical listing has been translated into a reference data model that is the basis for designing an information system for tracking and tracing. Materials that are modelled this way represent production and/or purchase lots or batches. The composition of a certain end product is then represented through modelling all its constituent materials along with their intermediate relations. By registering all relations between sub-ordinate and super-ordinate material lots, a method of tracking the composition of the end product is obtained. When the entire sequence of operations required for manufacturing an end product adheres to this registering of relations, a multilevel bill of lots can be compiled. That bill of lots then, provides the necessary information to determine the composition of a material item out of component items. These composition data can be used to recall any items having consumed a certain component of specific interest (e.g., deficient), but also to certify product quality or to pro-actively adjust production processes to optimise the product quality in relation to its production characteristics (e.g., scarcity, costs or time).","['Mh Monique Jansen-Vullers', 'van Ca Kees-Jan Dorp', 'Ajm Beulens']",298,"['6d33329b-81e8-417c-bade-cc965ea06eb2', 'fb91d620-c366-464c-a824-d5ce96975424']",Managing traceability information in manufacture,International Journal of Information Management,2003,4ac607a0-0cd1-47f1-9a7e-ddb978d12d63

Additionally the restructuring exercise allows for the addition of several more experiments enabling us to cover a broader portion of the course in the practical component.

"Minimizing communication and synchronization costs is crucial to the realization of the performance potential of parallel computers. This paper presents a general technique which uses a global data-flow framework to optimize communication and synchronization in the context of the one-way communication model. In contrast to the conventional send/receive message-passing communication model, one-way communication is a new paradigm that decouples message transmission and synchronization. In parallel machines with appropriate low-level support, this may open up new opportunities not only to further optimize communication, but also to reduce the synchronization overhead. We present optimization techniques using our framework for eliminating redundant data communication and synchronization operations. Our approach works with the most general data alignments and distributions in languages like High Performance Fortran (HPF) and uses a combination of the traditional data-flow analysis and polyhedral algebra.

"Pattern mining algorithms are often much easier applied than quantitatively assessed. In this paper we address the pattern evaluation problem by looking at both the capability of models and the difficulty of target concepts. We use four different data mining models: frequent itemset mining, k-means clustering, hidden Markov model, and hierarchical hidden Markov model to mine 39 concept streams from the a 137-video broadcast news collection from TRECVID-2005. We hypothesize that the discovered patterns can reveal semantics beyond the input space, and thus evaluate the patterns against a much larger concept space containing 192 concepts defined by LSCOM. Results show that HHMM has the best average prediction among all models, however different models seem to excel in different concepts depending on the concept prior and the ontological relationship. Results also show that the majority of the target concepts are better predicted with temporal or combination hypotheses, and there are novel concepts found that are not part of the original lexicon. This paper presents the first effort on temporal pattern mining in the large concept space. There are many promising directions to use concept mining to help construct better concept detectors or to guide the design of multimedia ontology.","['Lexing Xie', 'Shih-Fu Chang']",17,"['42633d59-7cea-4ef4-89cf-41a289279925', '46242d38-c986-430d-ae17-81369cfa6c8d']",Pattern Mining in Visual Concept Streams,international conference on multimedia and expo,2006,4ac6a18b-ff51-4a80-9e36-c79050129ec6
"Service compositions need to continuously self- adapt to cope with unexpected failures. In this context adaptation becomes a fundamental requirement that must be elicited along with the other functional and non functional requirements. Beside modelling, effective adaptation also demands means to trigger it at runtime as soon as the actual behavior of the composition deviates from stated requirements. This paper extends traditional goal models with adaptive goals to support continuous adaptation. Goals become live, runtime entities whose satisfaction level is dynamically updated. Furthermore, boundary infringement triggers adaptation capabilities. The paper also provides a methodology to trace goals onto the underlying composition, assess goals satisfaction at runtime, and activate adaptation consequently. All the key elements are demonstrated on the definition of the process to control an advanced washing machine.","['Luciano Baresi', 'Liliana Pasquale']",38,"['072b8e07-4172-4757-bb1d-ca899647e283', '0b0930c2-b311-46ab-9a24-53b290907c8a', '202a0106-ad0d-413b-bdb2-5d39de513003', '435ca080-ce9e-4f88-8e53-9c87578a7cab', '62573d4e-f8d5-4682-888c-d3717998e013', '65acba26-3449-48c8-ac84-83465430d11b', '69220232-821f-4e21-8d99-3decfb2f9da6', '80b78517-d8ec-4ce0-a113-ca2c3fb93b02', '9b1c5228-5c70-474d-ae3e-0a110d7e236a', 'c0b4ac1c-9ad0-4178-ace9-3d9b93b9b0fb', 'd18d8bdb-a283-4794-ab86-9d243b4c1448', 'de78a95b-3979-4bda-8f29-226d75bffbfa', 'e6420626-dd31-4e33-ab3e-7781aeb3673a', 'ebedb671-a710-4534-aaca-60bd9bb0db21', 'f88beacd-4e64-4174-bfe8-8249902f6983']",Adaptive Goals for Self-Adaptive Service Compositions,international conference on web services,2010,4ac6a708-9918-4ef0-87af-3590a5699afe
"There is a growing consensus that a portfolio of customers with different demand lead times can lead to higher, more regular revenues and better capacity utilization. Customers with positive demand lead times place orders in advance of their needs, resulting inadvance demand information. This gives rise to the problem of finding effective inventory control policies under advance demand information. We show that state-dependent ( s, S) and base-stock policies are optimal for stochastic inventory systems with and without fixed costs. The state of the system reflects our knowledge of advance demand information. We also determine conditions under which advance demand information has no operational value. A numerical study allows us to obtain additional insights and to evaluate strategies to induce advance demand information.","['Guillermo Gallego', 'Özalp Özer']",305,"['1add6785-bdfc-4268-8f13-69d9e0bbd922', '4d061f0b-5b6b-46ad-b297-7a101c122d98', '4e2b47a8-b682-4dd8-8d7d-7f48520921cd', '89be5050-094a-4760-b1db-4b62673b0c4b', 'c8caf546-bcd1-46c8-8e87-4c0c7662c820', 'd8c4aa0c-6b35-40af-90bf-83a42bd20130']",Integrating Replenishment Decisions with Advance Demand Information,Management Science,2001,4ac6aa7a-bdc5-4bc4-bdac-3120a7499717

"Digital magnetic and optical storage systems employing NRZI recording use (d, k) codes. The d-parameter specifies the minimum number of 0's occurring between 1's while the k-parameter specifies the maximum number of 0's between l's. The n-track (d,k) codes (denoted as (d,k;n) codes) are extensions of (d, k) codes for use in multiple-track systems. Instead of imposing each track to individually satisfy both constraints, (d,k;n) codes satisfy the d-constraint in each track individually while relaxing the k-constraint by allowing it to be satisfied jointly by the multiple tracks. Although (d,k;n) codes can provide significant capacity increases over (d, k) codes, they suffer from the fact that a single faulty track can cause loss of synchronization and hence, loss of the data on all tracks. Orcutt and Marcellin (see IEEE Trans. on Inform. Theory, Sept., 1993) introduced n-track (d,k) codes with a redundancy of r (denoted as (d,k;n,r) codes) which allow for r faulty tracks by mandating that all subsets of n-r tracks satisfy the joint k-constraint. We propose a new method to construct (d,k; n, r) codes. These codes have simple encoding and decoding schemes, gain a large part of the capacity increase possible when using (d,k; n,r) codes, and are considerably more robust to faulty tracks. >","['Ligang Ke', 'Michael W.

"De novo design systems provide powerful methods to suggest a set of novel structures with high estimated binding affinity. One deficiency of these methods is that some of the suggested structures could be synthesized only with great difficulty. We devised a scoring method that rapidly evaluates synthetic accessibility of structures based on structural complexity, similarity to available starting materials and assessment of strategic bonds where a structure can be decomposed to obtain simpler fragments. These individual components were combined to an overall score of synthetic accessibility by an additive scheme. The weights of the scoring function components were calculated by linear regression analysis based on accessibility scores derived from medicinal chemists. The calculated values for synthetic accessibility agree with the values proposed by chemists to an extent that compares well with how chemists agree with each other.","['Krisztina Boda', 'Thomas Seidel', 'Johann Gasteiger']",108,"['03cd609f-a06e-4f6d-95ba-9ce0327a9597', '191dcafb-dce1-4b27-add9-ae8ca5a1e1a1', '29c9d418-35f0-4c98-bb02-65864089b169', '35e20b91-7d42-4965-9069-4f6de9f1044a', '3de9ce38-c576-4a49-bae0-6d9d92047bba', '78fc6f3e-50bf-4add-a248-73cf4c2c268a', 'a14cda35-1d44-4b9f-8b57-e921e56fc48b']",Structure and reaction based evaluation of synthetic accessibility,Journal of Computer-aided Molecular Design,2007,4ac6d144-23f9-4ea1-9b59-0628d6b06a45

This represents a pivotal point in business operations of data communication services for service providers and large enterprises.

"Motivation: The widespread coiled-coil structural motif in proteins is known to mediate a variety of biological interactions. Recognizing a coiled-coil containing sequence and locating its coiled-coil domains are key steps towards the determination of the protein structure and function. Different tools are available for predicting coiled-coil domains in protein sequences, including those based on positionspecific score matrices and machine learning methods. Results: In this article, we introduce a hidden Markov model (CCHMM_PROF) that exploits the information contained in multiple sequence alignments (profiles) to predict coiled-coil regions. The new method discriminates coiled-coil sequences with an accuracy of 97% and achieves a true positive rate of 79% with only 1% of false positives. Furthermore, when predicting the location of coiled-coil segments in protein sequences, the method reaches an accuracy of 80% at the residue level and a best per-segment and perprotein efficiency of 81% and 80%, respectively. The results indicate that CCHMM_PROF outperforms all the existing tools and can be adopted for large-scale genome annotation.

"Simulation experiments show that the token ring protocol gave a lower average message delay at low transfer rates, but the token bus protocol gave a better overall performance for applications where only average delay is of interest. On the other hand, in hard real-time systems, the criterion of importance is not the average message delay, but the maximum message delay and the ability to meet deadlines. Slotted ring in this case is a much better protocol than the others because of its low maximum message delay and more predictable message delay. Because of this, and because the average performance of the slotted ring remains good as the size or the transfer rate of the network increases, the slotted ring protocol is preferred over the token ring and token bus protocols for hard real-time systems. >","['Joseph Kee-Yin Ng', 'Jane W.

The paper presents a new and simple algorithm for decomposing a convex structuring element as a sequence of Minkowski additions of a minimum number of subsets of the elementary square (i.e., the 3/spl times/3 square centered at the origin). Besides its simplicity, the advantage of this algorithm over some known algorithms is that it generates a sequence of non necessarily convex subsets, which means subsets with smaller cardinality and consequently faster implementation of the corresponding dilations and erosions. The algorithm is based on algebraic and geometrical properties of Minkowski additions. Theoretical analysis of correctness and computational time complexity are also presented.","['Ronaldo Fumio Hashimoto', 'Junior Barrera']",1,"['0651dfc5-3d65-4152-9c5b-7fbf3af64f6c', '102ec9b5-182b-4e76-aed3-8b72b9696c3b', '336de2a4-9390-404d-b91b-41b5b6370063', '34380515-7005-4a8a-af08-481f3a95924f', '3879350b-2a75-4ffa-adfe-941cad99d4b9', '400b6cd0-3033-4cc5-a6ad-ca5f5251e39e', '46fc0919-26df-40e4-8d46-6d37a074a783', '4941a7a9-c251-4040-9db4-d14eeb42b567', '49b4a75f-5c41-4704-bda6-06843f553c52', '4e631ef0-fad7-4dc0-901a-29af722c2169', '6b8fb510-b826-42d3-ae4e-b92f901efc76', '975bc2e6-c8ab-41ae-9d75-22f3ce69b482', 'bf665c72-4569-437b-bccf-1a8ee0c1d3c4', 'c6cbdd69-ef4c-418a-9a37-2799df4d7707', 'dd6807a2-a5de-4e3b-a18f-5e5992c56ff7', 'fc97f1e5-29da-4909-956d-0bd24754fcdc']",A simple algorithm for decomposing convex structuring elements,,1999,4ac75363-8577-49e7-80f8-971fa01532ba
"A new design methodology for a pattern generator is proposed, formulated in the context of on-chip BIST. The design methodology is circuit-specific and uses synthesis techniques to design BIST generators. The pattern generator consists of two components: a pseudorandom pattern generator (like an LFSR or, preferably, a GLFSR) and a combinational logic to map the outputs of the pseudorandom pattern generator. This combinational logic is synthesized to produce a given set of target patterns by mapping the outputs of the pseudorandom pattern generator. It is shown that, for a particular CUT, an area-efficient combinational logic block can be designed/synthesized to achieve 100 (or almost 100) percent single stuck-at fault coverage using a small number of test the This method is significantly different from weighted pattern generation and can guarantee testing of all hard-to-detect faults without expensive test point insertion.

Abstract#R##N##R##N#The Systolic Pixel or Spixel is a novel architecture for an intelligent pixel-based graphics database for geometric-solid models. An algorithm is described which performs visible surface calculations for any complexity of coloured 3-dimensional (3-D) surface and which structures geometric-solid model data in a natural way. The algorithm/architecture of the spixel features a simple set of priority rules acting upon data in nearest neighbour locations and a simple set of movement rules of data to nearest neighbour locations. The spixel is constructed out of identical functional units. These features are attractive for an implementation of the algorithm in Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI).,['Pam Mills'],50,[],The Systolic Pixel: A Visible Surface Algorithm for VLSI.,Computer Graphics Forum,1984,4ac7b3ec-45fb-44f9-978d-1746e7682736
We study the use of rich syntax-based statistical models for generating grammatical case for the purpose of machine translation from a language which does not indicate case explicitly (English) to a language with a rich system of surface case markers (Japanese). We propose an extension of n-best re-ranking as a method of integrating such models into a statistical MT system and show that this method substantially outperforms standard n-best re-ranking. Our best performing model achieves a statistically significant improvement over the baseline MT system according to the BLEU metric. Human evaluation also confirms the results.,"['Kristina Toutanova', 'Hisami Suzuki']",50,"['1268112c-a3a5-411d-9469-c9937aed533e', '143db266-038d-4496-882d-bc1abbd6c57c', '22616579-f9d8-4f34-956a-41761f11977c', '89dc7280-10d5-4bdb-b631-011ca3f08ebf', '91877231-41b1-4ef3-bcb4-bd36067aaa85', 'bd232ad9-8429-41d3-b83b-71fd8f6c8371', 'c2437e36-d765-4cc5-be03-315b6e35416c', 'ce4797cd-6c48-41a1-9f29-9962b0262703', 'de700a30-0634-4ff3-ae48-c0b5239420e3', 'e0c0f15e-65cc-4b54-a637-a2ef31426483', 'e9da7e93-7896-424e-91de-e2a630c081b7']",Generating Case Markers in Machine Translation,north american chapter of the association for computational linguistics,2007,4ac7b418-4f7c-4f99-8a47-2799a60896ef
"The performance of a soft-limiter metric and a quantized soft-limiter metric is evaluated for coded DS/DPSK (direct sequence/differential phase shift keying) in the presence of worst case pulse jamming and background noise. The metrics are easy to implement and do not require jammer state information. Instead they rely on the use of receiver thresholds, which must be adjusted according to the code rate and the received bit-energy-to-background-noise ratio. The performance of the metrics is evaluated by using the cutoff rate criterion and a number of specific convolutional and block codes. It is shown that the metrics can offer a significant soft-decision decoding gain and can perform to within 0.5-1.5 dB of the maximum-likelihood soft-decision metric with perfect jammer state information. >",['Gordon L.

"Because Function Point Analysis (FPA) has now been in use for a decade, and in spite of its increasing popularity has met with some recent criticisms, it is time to review how appropriate it still is for today's technologies. A critical review of the FPA approach examines in particular the pioneering and continuing work of Albrecht and more recent work by Symons. Technological dependencies in FPA-type metrics are identified and a general model for deriving a new FPA-type metric for a new software technology is given. A model for the calibration of FPA-type metrics for new technologies in terms of a reference technology is also presented. Such calibration is essential for comparative productivity studies. The role of module estimation in exposing parts of the 'anatomy' of the FPA approach is investigated. The derivation and calibration models are applied to a significant case study in which a new FPA-type metric suited to a particular software development technology is derived, calibrated and compared with other published versions of FPA metrics.","['June M.

"The experimental results in this paper demonstrate that a simple pruning/retraining method effectively improves the generalization performance of recurrent neural networks trained to recognize regular languages. The technique also permits the extraction of symbolic knowledge in the form of deterministic finite-state automata (DFA) which are more consistent with the rules to be learned. Weight decay has also been shown to improve a network's generalization performance. Simulations with two small DFA (/spl les/10 states) and a large finite-memory machine (64 states) demonstrate that the performance improvement due to pruning/retraining is generally superior to the improvement due to training with weight decay.

"In this paper, we present a novel technique for the design of FIR and IIR digital filters. The design approach begins with the specification of a discrete set of arbitrary magnitude and phase characteristics which describe a desired filter response. These frequency domain characteristics are used to create an ideal ""pseudo-filter"" whose impulse response is unknown and possibly non-causal, but whose input/output characteristics can be determined for a finite sum of sinusoids. Time-domain techniques common to adaptive system identification are then used to identify a realizable FIR or IIR digital filter which best matches the pseudo-filter. The advantages of this method include the ability to specify response at arbitrarily-spaced frequencies, to use arbitrary cost weighting, and to apply (possibly non-linear) constraints to the range of the filter coefficients.","['Bernard Widrow', 'Paul F.

"This paper presents the result of the experimental examination by ""passing each other"" and ""positional prediction"" in simulated interactive situation between people and mobile robot. We have developed four prototype robots based on four proposed methods for preliminarily announcing and indicating to people the speed and direction of upcoming movement of mobile robot moving on two-dimensional plane. We observed significant difference between when there was a preliminary-announcement and indication (PAI) function and when there was not even in each experiment. Therefore the effect of preliminary-announcement and indication of upcoming operation was declared. In addition the feature and effective usage of each type of preliminary-announcement and indication method were clarified. That is, the method of announcing state of operation just after the present is effective when a person has to judge to which direction he should get on immediately due to the feature that simple information can be quickly transmitted. The method of indicating operations from the present to some future time continuously is effective when a person wants to avoid contact or collision surely and correctly owing to the feature that complicated information can be accurately transmitted.

"In recent years, diversity techniques have evolved into highly attractive technology for wireless communications in different forms. For instance, the channel fluctuations of the users in a network are exploited as multiuser diversity by scheduling the user with the best signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). When fading is slow, beamforming at a multiple antenna transmitter is used to induce artificial channel fluctuations to ensure multiuser diversity in the network. Such a beamforming scheme is called opportunistic beamforming since the transmitter uses random beamforming to artificially induce opportunism in the network [1]. Opportunism requires a large number of users in the system in order to reach the performance of the true beamforming that uses perfect channel state information (CSI). In this paper we investigate the benefit of having partial CSI at an opportunistic transmitter. In the investigation, we focus on the maximum normalized SNR scheduling where user's feedback consists of SNR relative to its channel gain. We show that opportunism can be beneficially used to increase the average throughput of the system. Simulations support the analytical average throughput results obtained as the amount of CSI and the number of users vary.","['Ozgur Ozdemir', 'Murat Torlak']",6,"['23470605-f05f-40a3-81f0-5840e8225dab', '428771c4-4ff7-4564-8817-4bdc866f8ea9', '46351753-24cb-4ebd-a2eb-db6a46dcdca0', '57b89745-790c-4c68-b723-9c28f1babe07', '7bf3ba35-30e2-46e7-8327-f0bf8318a8b3', 'cb803f66-65de-4468-b903-1c68fd703131', 'dd3151e6-9756-4260-bc37-3507976fa578', 'e42e5794-980e-44b7-b4c9-15dbb812ad8c', 'e978280f-0a98-4085-a9b1-c51d9ee42388', 'f1f98a8e-776b-4598-ba23-6bfb37ed2636']",Opportunistic Beamforming over Rayleigh Channels with Partial Side Information,IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,2008,4ac81113-2e89-4dba-ad8e-303e7c13ebfb

We also present three modifications that relax one or more constraints in the optimal formulation in order to obtain smaller run times. We present experimental analysis by applying the formulations on an MPEG decoder algorithm. All results are compared against two existing techniques. Our formulations result in large system-level power reductions (max: 48.2%, min: 15.92%, avg: 31.9%).

"Grass seeds are complex organs composed by multiple tissues and cell types which develop coordinately to produce a viable embryo. The identification of genes involved in seed development is of great interest, but systematic spatial analyses of gene expression on maize seeds at the cell level have not yet been performed. MASISH is an online database holding information for gene expression spatial patterns in maize seeds based on in situ hybridization experiments. The web-based query interface allows the execution of gene queries and provides hybridization images, published references and information of the analyzed genes. Availability: http://masish.uab.cat/ Contact: cvsgmp@cid.csic.es The maize kernel is classified botanically as a caryopsis. In consequence it is a fruit composed by one seed and the remnants of the seed coats and nucellus and is permanently enclosed in the pericarp. The endosperm occupies most of the seed and is basically a storage organ that accumulates starch and proteins. The aleurone layer is part of the endosperm and consists in a continuous layer of large cubical cells which accumulate protein and lipid granules and surrounds most of the endosperm. In the area of the pedicel, which connects the seed to the mother plant, the cells adopt a special morphology, typical of transfer cells, and form the basal transfer cell layer. The embryo consists of an embryonic axis and a single cotyledon, which is called the scutellum. The embryo axis is formed by the plumule, covered by the coleoptile and the radicle, covered by coleorhiza. All these organs are almost completely surrounded by the scutellum, an organ whose major function is to accumulate nutrient reserves, mainly lipids and proteins. A single layer of cells directly in contact with the endosperm, which is called the scutellar epithelium, is important in the digestion and transport of the nutrients from the endosperm to the embryo axis during germination. Both endosperm and embryo derive from the fusion of gametes, but while the embryo is derived from the fertilized egg, triploid endosperm is derived from fertilized polar nuclei. Surrounding the endosperm and embryo lays the pericarp, a protective organ derived from maternal tissues (more information at http://masish.uab.cat/masish/images/maizeseedanatomy.pdf).

"This paper presents, for the first time, a unified blind method for multi-image super-resolution (MISR or SR), single-image blur deconvolution (SIBD), and multi-image blur deconvolution (MIBD) of low-resolution (LR) images degraded by linear space-invariant (LSI) blur, aliasing, and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). The proposed approach is based on alternating minimization (AM) of a new cost function with respect to the unknown high-resolution (HR) image and blurs. The regularization term for the HR image is based upon the Huber-Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a type of variational integral that exploits the piecewise smooth nature of the HR image. The blur estimation process is supported by an edge-emphasizing smoothing operation, which improves the quality of blur estimates by enhancing strong soft edges toward step edges, while filtering out weak structures. The parameters are updated gradually so that the number of salient edges used for blur estimation increases at each iteration. For better performance, the blur estimation is done in the filter domain rather than the pixel domain, i.e., using the gradients of the LR and HR images. The regularization term for the blur is Gaussian (L2 norm), which allows for fast noniterative optimization in the frequency domain.

"Recent research in generalizing quantum computation from 2-valued qudits to d-valued qudits has shown practical advantages for scaling up a quantum computer. A further generalization leads to quantum computing with hybrid qudits where two or more qudits have different finite dimensions. Advantages of hybrid and d-valued gates (circuits) and their physical realizations have been studied in detail by Muthukrishnan and Stroud [Multi-valued logic gates for quantum computation, Phys. Rev. A 62 (2000) 052309. [10]], Daboul et al. [Quantum gates on hybrid qudits, J. Phys. A Math. Gen. 36 (2003) 2525-2536. [5]], and Bartlett et al. [Quantum encodings in spin systems and harmonic oscillators, Phys. Rev. A 65 (2002) 052316. [17]]. In both cases, a quantum computation is performed when a unitary evolution operator, acting as a quantum logic gate, transforms the state of qudits in a quantum system. Unitary operators can be represented by square unitary matrices. If the system consists of a single qudit, then Tilma et al. [Generalized Euler angle parameterization for SU(N), J. Phys. A Math. Gen. 35 (2002) 10467-10501. [15]] have shown that the unitary evolution matrix (gate) can be synthesized in terms of its Euler angle parametrization. However, if the quantum system consists of multiple qudits, then a gate may be synthesized by matrix decomposition techniques such as QR factorization and the cosine-sine decomposition (CSD). In this article, we present a CSD based synthesis method for n qudit hybrid quantum gates, and as a consequence, derive a CSD based synthesis method for n qudit gates where all the qudits have the same dimension.","['Faisal Shah Khan', 'Marek A.

Abstract   Let  A ( H ) be the arrangement of a set H of n hyperplanes in  d -space. A  k -flat is a  k -dimensional affine subspace of  d -space. The  zone  of a  k -flat f with respect to H is the set of all faces in  A ( H ) that intersect f. this paper we study some problems on zones of  k -flats. Our most important result is a data structure for point location in the zone of a  k -flat. This structure uses   O  (n      ⌊  d  2  ⌋+e    +n     k+e   )   preprocessing time and space and has a query time of O(log 2   n ). We also show how to test efficiently whether two flats are visible from each other with respect to a set of hyperplanes. Then point location in m faces in arrangements is studied. Our data structure for this problem has size   O  (n      ⌊  d  2  ⌋+e    m      ⌈  d  2  ⌉  d    )   and the query time is O(log 2   n ).,"['Mark de Berg', 'Marc J. van Kreveld', 'Otfried Schwarzkopf', 'Jack Snoeyink']",5,"['03e6b6dc-7077-49f3-8f6f-558f13e498a6', '04b85a51-0611-4690-be84-9ac7bb80ddd4', '1bb7e651-6703-413c-b8d1-10f8e8867205', '251815a3-8350-4b1c-993d-20bcd8ce4788', '28cab176-2ea5-45f1-aea8-666a8acc2861', '354511c3-2734-4838-bdd7-8be81794e2fc', '394fcdc7-5d9b-4180-9c32-1be37a0c7061', '3f1323cb-140d-40d6-8635-92d5b9107de9', '513ef136-d6cf-4d7b-bd8c-68328c18aa91', '5493aef1-42ec-42e6-8f5e-4239a8feb947', '6e7e2636-69d7-405c-aebc-b38b8d4d719d', '71e7d436-a839-4f9d-ad70-d9faf15e8034', 'ad396711-0881-424d-b3de-409ac46c2061', 'b7694933-0515-4214-8f61-27f1df56a531', 'bda45c60-bb84-42d0-b227-da383ddd68bb', 'be9cbf3c-2975-4226-b6b9-3d4b4ebe8a66', 'c9f1dced-d81b-4903-b134-c197cb05b999', 'd0b4e3e2-e311-4441-9f90-37d6ff42a193', 'e1e3bb01-cb12-42e2-919a-0b844ef75038']",Point location in zones of k -flats in arrangements,Computational Geometry: Theory and Applications,1996,4ac87154-be08-4020-8544-a71f3aeccada
"The goal of this paper is to address the problem of dynamic optimal battery array management to extend the life of battery array used in the hybrid power source. Unlike previous efforts which mainly solve the problem using the off-line optimization, our design addresses the problem using the idea of “feedback”. The proposed approach can handle the possible dynamic uncertainty of the hybrid power source introduced by battery failure or insert of a new battery. The detailed battery model and the converter model are derived to facilitate development of dynamic optimal management algorithm. The other goal of this paper is to call possible attention of the control community in potential contribution for newest smart grid technology.","['Yun She', 'Xu She']",50,['29b46504-ae8a-4dbc-954d-90cd09990d59'],Dynamic optimal battery array management in high energy density fuel cell/battery hybrid power source,conference on decision and control,2010,4ac87997-0f77-492f-8f7b-0307fc2d8fa5
"Methods for hidden structure of high-dimensional binary data discovery are one of the most important challenges facing machine learning community researchers. There are many approaches in literature that try to solve this hitherto rather ill-defined task. In the present study, we propose a most general generative model of binary data for Boolean factor analysis and introduce new Expectation-Maximization Boolean Factor Analysis algorithm which maximizes likelihood of Boolean Factor Analysis solution. Using the so-called bars problem benchmark, we compare efficiencies of Expectation-Maximization Boolean Factor Analysis algorithm with Dendritic Inhibition neural network. Then we discuss advantages and disadvantages of both approaches as regards results quality and methods efficiency.","['A. A.

"In this paper, a new bridgeless single-ended primary inductance converter power-factor-correction rectifier is introduced. The proposed circuit provides lower conduction losses with reduced components simultaneously. In conventional PFC converters (continuous-conduction-mode boost converter), a voltage loop and a current loop are required for PFC. In the proposed converter, the control circuit is simplified, and no current loop is required while the converter operates in discontinuous conduction mode. Theoretical analysis and simulation results are provided to explain circuit operation. A prototype of the proposed converter is realized, and the results are presented. The measured efficiency shows 1% improvement in comparison to conventional SEPIC rectifier.","['Mohammad Mahdavi', 'Hosein Farzanehfard']",163,"['25afb61e-5c3c-4733-9995-c95f3f028276', 'bf33c0a9-9cb3-4577-b7a5-1131a3f9a36f', 'c58b5ab8-d471-4bb2-bc47-b8d4d8de0a28', 'ce13960f-fd9d-4eeb-812b-50a7ef8acc8e']",Bridgeless SEPIC PFC Rectifier With Reduced Components and Conduction Losses,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2011,4ac8830f-3b94-4141-87ad-da094724bdc0
"Quantization plays an important role in many systems where analog-to-digital conversion and/or digital-to-analog conversion take place. If the quantization error is correlated with the input signal, then the spectrum of the quantization error will contain spurious peaks. Although analytical formulas describing this effect exist, numerical evaluation can take much effort. This brief provides approximations for the spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of a uniform quantizer with a single sinusoidal input, with and without additive Gaussian noise. It is shown that the SFDR increases by approximately 8 dB/bit, in case there is no noise. Generalizing this result to multitone inputs results in an additional 2 dB/bit per additional tone. Additive Gaussian noise decorrelates the sinusoid(s) and the quantization error, which results in a dramatic increase in SFDR.","['M.S. Oude Alink', 'Andre B. J. Kokkeler', 'E.A.M.

"The paper revisits three distributed shared memory (DSM) architectures to clarify them with their binding times for new addresses at the local memory: page fault time, node miss time, and cache miss time. The DSM architectures which have different binding times arrange data in different ways with different overheads at an event of reference. Since a large number of cache misses can occur in a large (relative to the cache size) working set, binding at the page fault time alone cannot efficiently utilize locality of reference at the local memory. In a small working set, most of the addresses bound to the local memory at a node miss time are not effective due to the low cache miss rate. The paper shows that binding at the cache miss time can improve system performance.","['Jinseok Kong', 'Gyungho Lee']",0,"['11b345d6-7ed7-4201-a2f8-67830fcce121', '4b03f689-3acd-475c-b058-e519f8c152ce', '5383bfb3-5735-4246-a0e0-fee380c560c3', '58778a43-510b-4821-b5cd-1c2c430db2e1', '5a62e012-673d-4ff9-bcee-b4e61bd204db', '5c229bca-80b1-442e-9f9a-9e7a18f09afd', '6ea7d36f-b372-4a20-b5a7-effbacd93a5d', '8ebe8f93-e7bf-4b97-8301-aad5ff53d045', '99d86b25-2586-4184-8035-0d3e32441577', 'a109db76-956d-41ec-b487-0080b96bfd9a', 'a4f95e3a-17b0-46ed-a588-341d2bc53a33', 'be70b988-e915-4ca6-8102-7edf89b3b035', 'c0f8eb95-a6bd-4dbe-8edf-244dcf9ad7f5', 'd8759d40-7707-443a-a7fa-039a5113a961', 'e6ffd871-5c54-446c-8ee1-f8b3d4e91d10', 'ede3a3ef-49b5-4c4b-8a13-65974345271a', 'ee04883b-0f7b-4610-b89b-282c8a0f989a']",Binding time in distributed shared memory architectures,international conference on parallel processing,1998,4ac8c050-c706-404b-924b-5bd204736191

Our work proposes a theoretical framework to monitor and reason about human intention and its changes, which in turn can be used to determine how software and services should evolve to be individualized and better serve each user. Extending the Situ framework, we explore the service satisfiability problem through sub-world coverage following Kripke semantics, which enjoys wide application in AI and other fields related to human epistemic reasoning.","['Hua Ming', 'Carl K.

In this paper we deduce the evolution of a four wheeled active suspension rover from a five wheeled passive suspension rover. The aim of this paper is to design a suspension mechanism which utilizes the advantages of both passive suspension and active suspension rover. Both the design considered here are simpler than the existing suspension mechanisms in the sense that the number of links as wells as the number of joints have been significantly reduced without compromising the climbing capability of the rover. We first analyze the kinematics of the five wheeled rover and its motion pattern while climbing an obstacle and try to deduce the same motion pattern and capability in the four wheeled rover. Both the suspension mechanism consists of two planar closed kinematic chains on each side of the rover. We also deduce the control strategy for the active suspension rover wherein only two actuators are used to control the internal configuration of the rover. To the best of author's knowledge this is the minimum number of actuators required to control the internal configuration of a active suspension while operating on a fully 3D rough terrain. Extensive uneven terrain simulations are performed for both 5-wheeled and 4-wheeled rover and a comparative analysis has been done on maximum coefficient of friction and torque requirements.,"['Arun Kumar Singh', 'Vijay Eathakota', 'K.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for real-time identification of these messages by using passively collects BGP messages. Our method focuses on the frequency of observed attributes and values of prefixes advertised by each AS. Based on our heuristics that common attributes are observed at similar time scale, we periodically measure the usage frequency of attributes from BGP messages observed in real-time and mark attributes and values used by minority of the AS as suspicious.

We evaluate the packet reception ratio, RSSI, LQI, and movement intensity of body under indoor and outdoor environments, all of which can provide direct insights to practical account.","['Guodong Sun', 'Guofu Qiao', 'Bin Xu']",9,"['05aa3c8d-42bc-4f4e-8d95-8bfcb8eee69e', '0c745303-37c0-4df5-851b-0bcba1e58565', '0f931299-2ff5-4957-9870-64afa9b3941c', '1cde803d-5500-45b3-984b-a9124f54b9f6', '1cf2c9c9-59ed-442c-b2aa-c19c89d4ba8f', '3ff20443-c7c3-4179-961c-2e1521c9de33', '4dd63e29-4225-420f-9d87-7358015443a2', '6c1543ba-ade0-49d0-ab35-15700cc5ddbd', '6e3a5166-35f2-4df5-b63e-07d796769dd9', '8bbe2fa5-afdd-4599-ad85-220ad0217245', '9c771700-5c82-4601-a974-6be9b9fb5fd8', 'b62b0000-a7aa-4476-9465-6b8864f566ef', 'cd2e1917-b717-4750-ad88-cdf859dabe3e', 'd52086b4-5eee-4931-94fc-b79a6b470a42', 'd8720f80-975a-487e-847b-d3c3a8d1a498', 'f4b39d0d-cb1e-4e7d-a8ef-966243d53182']",Link Characteristics Measuring in 2.4 GHz Body Area Sensor Networks,International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks,2012,4ac92753-a786-42b0-b929-e52638932a69
"This paper introduces a novel way to leverage the implicit geometry of sparse local features (e.g. SIFT operator) for the purposes of object detection and segmentation. A two-class Bayesian scheme is used as a framework, and the likelihood is derived from the real-valued classification of machine learning algorithm Gentle AdaBoost, whose output is transformed to a probabilistic distribution using either of two models investigated; Log-Sigmoid or Bi-Gaussian. The main contribution is a novel scheme for the injection of prior contextual spatial information. This occurs on a uniquely designed Markov Random Field defined by Delaunay Tri- angulation of the feature points. Our experiments show that this framework is useful for object detection and segmentation, and we achieve good, mostly invariant results in these tasks.","[""Deirdre O'Regan"", 'Anil C.

"In signal subspace parameter estimation techniques, like MUSIC, degradations may occur due to parasite peaks in the spectrum, which may be connected to high sidelobes in the beam pattern or to ambiguities themselves. This paper studies the presence of ambiguities in an array of given planar geometry. We propose a general framework for the analysis and thus we obtain a generalisation of results published by Lo and Marple (1992) and by Proukakis and Manikas (see Proc. ICASSP'94, vol.4, p.549-52, 1994) for rank one and two ambiguities. For rank k/spl ges/3 ambiguities the study is restricted to linear arrays, for which we derive original and synthetic results. We present a geometrical construction that is able to determine all the ambiguous directions which can appear for a given linear array. The method allows determination of any rank ambiguities and for each ambiguous direction set, the rank of ambiguity is obtained. The search is exhaustive. Application of the method requires no assumption for the linear array and is easy to implement. An example is detailed for a non-uniform linear array.","['Anne Flieller', 'Pascal Larzabal', 'H.

"During neurosurgery, nonrigid brain deformation prevents preoperatively acquired images from accurately depicting the intraoperative brain. Stereo vision systems can be used to track cortical surface deformation and update preoperative brain images in conjunction with a biomechanical model. However, these stereo systems are often plagued with calibration error, which can corrupt the deformation estimation. In order to decouple the effects of camera calibration and surface deformation, a framework is needed which can solve for disparate and often competing variables. Game theory, which was developed specifically to handle decision making in this type of competitive environment, has been applied to various fields from economics to biology. In this paper, we apply game theory to cortical surface tracking and use it to infer information about the physical processes of brain deformation and image acquisition.","['Christine DeLorenzo', 'Xenophon Papademetris', 'Lawrence H.

"Introduction of motion video including live video into networked virtual reality systems makes virtual spaces more attractive. To handle live video in networked virtual reality systems based on VRML, the scalability of networked virtual reality systems becomes very important on the Internet where the performance of the network and the end systems varies dynamically. We propose a new quality control mechanism suitable for networked virtual reality systems with live video capability. Our approach is to introduce the notion of the importance of presence (IoP) which represents the importance of objects in virtual spaces. According to IoP, the degree of the deterioration of object presentation will be determined in case of the starvation of system resources.","['Kazutoshi Fujikawa', 'Seiwoong Oh', 'Shinji Shimojo', 'Tomohiro Taira', 'Daisuke Kado', 'Hideo Miyahara']",50,"['406f694d-b550-4761-bfad-a7d61833d528', 'a0bea42a-f491-4ed5-8e38-3ed5e07dca34', 'bb7af19e-2fa5-40df-9513-d5dfbdf4bd7b']",A quality control mechanism for networked virtual reality system with video capability,international conference on multimedia computing and systems,1998,4ac9aaca-ad5a-4d13-923f-ca0a26daec19
"The development of the information systems (IS) literature inManagement Science during the past 50 years reflects the inception, growth, and maturation of several different research streams. The five research streams we identify incorporate different definitions of the managerial problems that relate to IS, the alternate theoretical perspectives and different methodological paradigms to study them, and the levels of the organization at which their primary results impact managerial practice. Thedecision support and design science research stream studies the application of computers in decision support, control, and managerial decision making. Thevalue of information research stream reflects relationships established based on economic analysis of information as a commodity in the management of the firm. Thehuman-computer systems design research stream emphasizes the cognitive basis for effective systems design. TheIS organization and strategy research stream focuses the level of analysis on the locus of value of the IS investment instead of on the perceptions of a system or its user. Theeconomics of information systems and technology research stream emphasizes the application of theoretical perspectives and methods from analytical and empirical economics to managerial problems involving IS and information technologies (IT). Based on a discussion of these streams, we evaluate the IS literature's core contributions to theoretical and managerial knowledge, and make some predictions about the road that lies ahead for IS researchers.","['Rajiv D.

"Matched filtering has been one of the most powerful techniques employed for transient detection. Here we will show that a dynamic neural network outperforms the conventional approach. When the artificial neural network (ANN) is trained with supervised learning schemes there is a need to supply the desired signal for all time, although we are only interested in detecting the transient. In this paper we also show the effects on the detection agreement of different strategies to construct the desired signal. The extension of the Bayes decision rule (0/1 desired signal), optimal in static classification, performs worse than desired signals constructed by random noise or prediction during the background.","['Jose C.

It is shown that the method only requires the simultaneous solution of two second-order nonlinear equations.,"['William W. Cimino', 'G. R.

"In this paper, we investigate the performance of heterogeneous networks with multi-antenna cooperative relays. Specifically, threshold-based maximum ratio combining (MRC) and selection combining (SC) schemes are adopted for decoding at the relays and the end-to-end (E2E) error rate performance is analyzed by assuming a Nakagami channel model. Numerical results show that the deployment of multi-antennas can reduce the number of required relay nodes, and thus significantly reduce the system cost. On the other hand, the selection of optimal decoding threshold depends on the number of relay nodes, number of antennas, as well as the average SNR value at the receiver. It is also demonstrated that when the BER requirement is not high, the SC relaying scheme is sufficient to provide satisfactory performance, such that the complexity of relays can be effectively reduced.","['Qianqian Zhang', 'Wenbo Wang', 'Wei Lan Huang', 'Jie Zhang']",1,"['5d8849cf-cc13-44fc-ad7f-807ce67916ad', '748a2ab3-8b5f-4d0a-9e2d-af685089843a', '972a5ec6-1ecd-4f8e-91b7-a81b1fc26d5b', 'efcbfcea-e8b0-4ca9-a883-92f42f862307']",Cooperative Multi-Antenna Relaying in Heterogeneous Networks,vehicular technology conference,2009,4aca2ef9-7e4d-4cae-a7ae-24391c159085

However, for most applications that need large and heterogeneous groups or crowds, more automatic methods of generating large numbers of humans, animals or other characters are needed. Fortunately, depending on the context, it is not the case that all types of variety are equally important.

Existing mobile malware detection techniques, which are often borrowed from solutions to Internet malware detection, do not perform as effectively due to the limited computing resources on mobile devices.#R##N##R##N#In this paper, we propose VirusMeter, a novel and general malware detection method, to detect anomalous behaviors on mobile devices. The rationale underlying VirusMeter is the fact that mobile devices are usually battery powered and any malicious activity would inevitably consume some battery power. By monitoring power consumption on a mobile device, VirusMeter catches misbehaviors that lead to abnormal power consumption. For this purpose, VirusMeter relies on a concise user-centric power model that characterizes power consumption of common user behaviors. In a real-time mode, VirusMeter can perform fast malware detection with trivial runtime overhead. When the battery is charging (referred to as a battery-charging mode), VirusMeter applies more sophisticated machine learning techniques to further improve the detection accuracy. To demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness, we have implemented a VirusMeter prototype on Nokia 5500 Sport and used it to evaluate some real cellphone malware, including FlexiSPY and Cabir. Our experimental results show that VirusMeter can effectively detect these malware activities with less than 1.5% additional power consumption in real time.","['Lei Liu', 'Guanhua Yan', 'Xinwen Zhang', 'Songqing Chen']",138,"['1ec9abf2-c5cb-4806-a2b7-4861188f0c10', '203d34d0-30ab-4c13-9325-672a56bd4934', '263f2ac6-613d-4de3-ab48-eeeb35d513c7', '2fe4a153-2f45-484d-8b3c-47d586a83238', '5476de43-cb3a-4f61-be89-7af5d0865ed8', '666e8a83-11a5-4c4e-a415-d6e368bd0b45', '673d4f50-2dcc-4776-b4e4-0560a79a125e', '6eb16d3e-d03a-43fd-914c-d63437b9e3b6', '74a78d6d-a862-4764-8def-256e92568647', '9691b324-85b5-4c17-af47-e1fe1df65682', 'c98845c8-dbe9-45bd-8861-ab0ecee0c911', 'ca8e8f0c-e115-4f4d-a10e-0ac82d3588bb', 'cb19f8e2-ec97-4424-8473-e3d56c87a977', 'e5d659c9-dc54-48f6-8af0-0da1135a40da']",VirusMeter: Preventing Your Cellphone from Spies,recent advances in intrusion detection,2009,4aca61d3-743d-4e10-8796-3cdb5c90e0db

"Scheduling packet transmission over wireless links requires quantification of the QoS performance such as delay and packet loss in terms of known system parameters. One of the key issues is how to account for effects of the compensation mechanism on the system's QoS performance. In this paper, we develop a model, namely the two-stage tandem queuing (TSTQ), to characterize the behaviors of packet flows in the system, which applies the wireless fair scheduling with the compensation mechanism. Using queueing analysis, we derive performance parameters: average delay and packet loss rate, in closed-form expressions. These expressions are functions of the source, wireless channel and compensation mechanism parameters. Moreover, the trade-off relationship between delay and packet loss rate is revealed, which is controlled by the parameter of lagging bound. Numerical and simulation results are used to verify the validity of the modeling and analysis work.","['Liang Zhang', 'Tak-Wai Lee']",50,"['3959df04-cd82-45cb-8f82-8df2d2517b0c', '76d9503a-ba1c-4326-8c6a-135ecdbc0759', 'b695b687-2fe5-4c12-9c2e-6a244cb09085', 'c7b0d60b-9956-4254-b6d3-26fb1f8782bb', 'd516becd-7bb6-4fea-a531-f9bc89ff377c', 'f0862f34-da4f-4ef4-9393-bece99bd473b']",Performance analysis of wireless fair queuing algorithms with compensation mechanism,international conference on communications,2004,4aca8a52-f42f-4097-a9a0-6b8362a00b72

Lattice QCD calculations were one of the first applications to show the potential of GPUs in the area of high performance computing. Our interest is to find ways to effectively use GPUs for lattice calculations using the overlap operator. The large memory footprint of these codes requires the use of multiple GPUs in parallel. In this paper we show the methods we used to implement this operator efficiently. We run our codes both on a GPU cluster and a CPU cluster with similar interconnects. We find that to match performance the CPU cluster requires 20-30 times more CPU cores than GPUs.,"['Andrei Alexandru', 'Michael Lujan', 'Craig Pelissier', 'Ben Gamari', 'Frank X.

"Subspace clustering coevolves the attribute space supporting clusters at the same time as parameterizing the cluster location and combination. Typically, a 'flat' representation is pursued in which individuals describe both the property of individual clusters as well as the combination of clusters used to define the overall solution; hereafter F-ESC. Conversely, a symbiotic approach was recently proposed in which candidate clusters and the combination of clusters are coevolved from independent populations; hereafter S-ESC. In this work a common framework is pursued in order for flat and symbiotic evolutionary subspace clustering to be compared directly. We show that F-ESC might match S-ESC results for data sets with high proportions of cluster support, however, the gap between the two algorithm increases as cluster support decreases.","['Ali Vahdat', 'Malcolm I.

"In this paper the topic of the augmented cognition applied to the driving task, and specifically to the steering maneuver, is discussed. We analyze how the presence of haptic feedback on the steering wheel could help drivers to perform a visually-guided task by providing relevant information like vehicle speed and trajectory. Starting from these considerations, a Context-Dependant Steering Wheel force feedback (CDSW) had been developed, able to provide to the driver the most suitable feeling of the vehicle dynamics according to the driven context. With a driving simulator the CSWD software had been tested twice and then compared with a traditional steering wheel.","['Luca Minin', 'Stefano Marzani', 'Francesco Tesauri', 'Roberto Montanari', 'Caterina Calefato']",50,"['2b88c57f-236b-4e34-b23f-f2e6d912e8c6', '4aa1e93d-9fb1-467e-b0bd-4a96fd5ba64c']",Context-Dependent Force-Feedback Steering Wheel to Enhance Drivers' On-Road Performances,,2009,4acacb6c-4b36-44bc-9023-6204c043d882
"The purpose of reverse engineering is to convert a large point cloud into an accurate, fair and consistent CAD model. For a class of conventional engineering objects we have the 'a priori' assumption that the object is bounded exclusively by simple, analytic surfaces. In this case it is possible to generate the model with a minimal amount of user interaction. The key issue is segmentation, i.e., to separate the point cloud into smaller regions, where each can be approximated by a single surface. While this is relatively simple, where the regions are bounded by sharp edges, problems arise when smoothly connected regions need to be separated. The direct segmentation method described in this paper is based on a special sequence of tests, by means of which a large point cloud can be robustly splitted into smaller subregions until no further subdivision is possible. Surfaces of linear extrusion and revolution are also detected. The structure of the smooth, multiple regions is the basis of constrained surface fitting in the final model building phase.","['Pál Benkö', 'Tamás Várady']",33,"['0aba23e8-eb3a-4423-b3fb-c29e6f20fbfd', '0badf7be-7f89-40c4-b53a-8c4fc90f4247', '150019e0-a95c-4d83-8129-1d226fb10b4a', '2922ed4d-f075-4862-899b-9faf3e0a4d0e', '2c62cb01-08f1-4372-b363-0a9d857c5ef9', '6fa09096-36d0-477a-a49e-5504803c44c0', '8e7518b7-8bfc-4ef2-81ad-7ffc73f3b016', '9a38e605-b175-4c1c-8e00-49ae7455ee32', 'a5a48455-df28-43b7-be8c-6696ec2bf07a', 'b5a678f9-adc7-431e-bf21-578d30f31c17', 'dbcdafef-ebca-4a4e-894a-f5d6ec2e1b07', 'e0c0368a-4d69-4d70-8edb-a59090157e43']","Direct segmentation of smooth, multiple point regions",geometric modeling and processing,2002,4acad504-c36d-4c9b-9ea6-d1517babbddb

"In human-robot interaction research, much attention is given to the extent to which people perceive humanlike attributes in robots. Generally, the concept anthropomorphism is used to describe this process. Anthropomorphism is defined in different ways, with much focus on either typical human attributes or uniquely human attributes. This difference has caused different measurement tools to be developed. We argue that anthropomorphism can best be described as a continuum ranging from low to high human likeness, and should be measured accordingly. We found that anthropomorphic characteristics can be invariantly ordered according to the ease with which these can be ascribed to robots.","['Peter A. M. Ruijten', 'Diane H.L. Bouten', 'Dana C.J.

Such a network enables the user to request past, present and future data from the network in the form of historical, one-time and persistent queries respectively.

"Multi-static passive radar (MPR) systems typically use narrowband signals and operate under weak signal conditions, making them difficult to reliably estimate motion parameters of ground moving targets. On the other hand, the availability of multiple spatially separated illuminators of opportunity provides a means to achieve multi-static diversity and overall signal enhancement. In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating motion parameters, including velocity and acceleration, of multiple closely located ground moving targets in a typical MPR platform with focus on weak signal conditions, where traditional time-frequency analysis-based methods become unreliable or infeasible. The underlying problem is reformulated as a sparse signal reconstruction problem in a discretized parameter search space. While the different bistatic links have distinct Doppler signatures, they share the same set of motion parameters of the ground moving targets. Therefore, such motion parameters act as a common sparse support to enable the exploitation of group sparsity-based methods for robust motion parameter estimation. This provides a means of combining signal energy from all available illuminators of opportunity and, thereby, obtaining a reliable estimation even when each individual signal is weak. Because the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of motion parameters involves a multi-dimensional search and its performance is sensitive to target position errors, we also propose a technique that decouples the target motion parameters, yielding a two-step process that sequentially estimates the acceleration and velocity vectors with a reduced dimensionality of the parameter search space. We compare the performance of the sequential method against the ML estimation with the consideration of imperfect knowledge of the initial target positions. The Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of the underlying parameter estimation problem is derived for a general multiple-target scenario in an MPR system. Simulation results are provided to compare the performance of the sparse signal reconstruction-based methods against the traditional time-frequency-based methods as well as the CRB.","['Saurav Subedi', 'Yimin Zhang', 'Moeness G.

"An on-line signature verification system exploiting both local and global information through decision-level fusion is presented. Global information is extracted with a feature-based representation and recognized by using Parzen Windows Classifiers. Local information is extracted as time functions of various dynamic properties and recognized by using Hidden Markov Models. Experimental results are given on the large MCYT signature database (330 signers, 16500 signatures) for random and skilled forgeries. Feature selection experiments based on feature ranking are carried out. It is shown experimentally that the machine expert based on local information outperforms the system based on global analysis when enough training data is available. Conversely, it is found that global analysis is more appropriate in the case of small training set size. The two proposed systems are also shown to give complementary recognition information which is successfully exploited using decision-level score fusion.","['Julian Fierrez-Aguilar', 'Loris Nanni', 'Jaime Lopez-Peñalba', 'Javier Ortega-Garcia', 'Davide Maltoni']",230,"['024c8069-85b9-49fc-827a-b84e6f0bcd46', '103239b2-e5b7-4ad5-8695-af5deaab90b5', '267c333e-61a8-46e4-8ef0-b4f502c50735', '2d0d3d7f-f864-456e-8790-6a8a81ffbaa5', '2da36bbf-24af-4ea8-abe8-aef95e7e75d8', '33e5923a-cc95-4189-ba4d-c014f83b0bfd', '55c5a991-2260-4298-aaba-175186709df6', '5ddcb7d0-cf4f-4019-95b2-dabea5ca4fd8', '69190718-b4c0-4175-b16f-22abfc8086c3', '7b57db11-7c4d-4d1e-aa62-3a5d7d1f7987', '82b25f90-fd79-4dfe-ac68-45864fad665d', '84b9623d-1643-4f1d-a7c9-62ed9cda24f9', '865b9085-134a-4a80-bc8f-770a63275d8c', '8fc771b9-0982-4bfe-b26f-6dff0878b293', '9096064d-fa26-471e-9e9e-251768d18362', '976c4962-f8c9-40f1-8888-777f5199861d', '9c7f3086-070b-4924-9241-82de6d8350e0', 'bf562618-9161-457f-8941-ca9c71652b69', 'd130ecec-e5cf-4f59-b4f8-1cbda4b0c307', 'd32ba741-b475-4661-b61a-1aef885a0a16', 'dfc0f05d-db07-4ee8-b0a6-0b3769584843', 'e2c41522-7614-4470-b29a-8a289703cf3f', 'eb6e82e0-e0b1-45e8-9f35-a89102dd7216', 'ee23effd-b354-4d18-bb4e-f923782887e8', 'fbac2138-ab49-41ab-9f6e-3748de9415ff']",An on-line signature verification system based on fusion of local and global information,european conference on computer vision,2005,4acbb2fb-b85b-425d-ad04-d5ab2e90b8f2
"Malignant melanoma is a cancer of the skin arising in the melanocytes. We present a mathematical model of melanoma invasion into healthy tissue with an immune response. We use this model as a framework with which to investigate primary tumor invasion and treatment by surgical excision. We observe that the presence of immune cells can destroy tumors, hold them to minimal expansion, or, through the production of angiogenic factors, induce tumorigenic expansion. We also find that the tumor–immune system dynamic is critically important in determining the likelihood and extent of tumor regrowth following resection. We find that small metastatic lesions distal to the primary tumor mass can be held to a minimal size via the immune interaction with the larger primary tumor. Numerical experiments further suggest that metastatic disease is optimally suppressed by immune activation when the primary tumor is moderately, rather than minimally, metastatic. Furthermore, satellite lesions can become aggressively tumorigenic upon removal of the primary tumor and its associated immune tissue. This can lead to recurrence where total cancer mass increases more quickly than in primary tumor invasion, representing a clinically more dangerous disease state. These results are in line with clinical case studies involving resection of a primary melanoma followed by recurrence in local metastases.","['Steffen Eikenberry', 'Craig J.

"We describe the geometry constraints and algorithmic implementation for metric rectification of planes. The rectification allows metric properties, such as angles and length ratios, to be measured on the world plane from a perspective image. The novel contributions are: first, that in a stratified context the various forms of providing metric information, which include a known angle, two equal though unknown angles, and a known length ratio; can all be represented as circular constraints on the parameters of an affine transformation of the plane-this provides a simple and uniform framework for integrating constraints; second, direct rectification from right angles in the plane; third, it is shown that metric rectification enables calibration of the internal camera parameters; fourth, vanishing points are estimated using a Maximum Likelihood estimator; fifth, an algorithm for automatic rectification. Examples are given for a number of images, and applications demonstrated for texture map acquisition and metric measurements.","['David Liebowitz', 'Andrew Zisserman']",440,"['6efaf413-e64a-434c-a387-1c37a40eca85', 'b98f0657-c56e-44db-b70f-f7cbebe5240d', 'ba090582-262b-4640-a5b3-714c472736ba', 'ea918d26-cd76-4aa3-9064-de9bb7247ecd', 'ece7f9f4-1f93-4f8e-8d9a-8987ed9f6b5a', 'f6779f97-9495-4387-b68c-e5fd5cf3462f']",Metric rectification for perspective images of planes,computer vision and pattern recognition,1998,4acbc4da-25d9-4183-a386-7628dbb37bcb
"Due to the resource constraints, pre-distributing secret keys into sensor nodes before they are deployed is an applicable approach to achieve information security in wireless sensor networks. Several key pre-distribution schemes have been proposed in literature to establish pairwise keys between sensor nodes; they are either too complicated, or insecure for some common attacks. To address these weaknesses, we propose an improved pairwise key establishment mechanism for wireless sensor networks in this paper. Compared with existing approaches, our scheme has better network resilience against node capture attack. Analysis and simulation results show that our scheme performs better than earlier proposed schemes in terms of network connectivity, key storage overhead, maximum supported network size, computational and communication overheads","['Yi Cheng', 'Dharma P.

A consequence of one of the results is that for arbitrary distinct combinators (closed lambda terms) M, M′, N, N′ there is a combinator H such thatdisplay formula hereThe general result, which comes from Statman (1998), is that uniformly r.e. partitions of the combinators, such that each ‘block’ is closed under β-conversion, are of the form {H−1{M}}M∈ΛΦ.

Then, E-UMTS traffic generation and activity models are described and characterised. System level simulations are carried out and the enhanced performance is demonstrated based in a single quality parameter, which simultaneously accounts for call blocking and handover failure probabilities. End-to-end delays do not present a limitation. By considering a grade of service of 1% for the quality parameter, and different hypothesis for costs and prices, an optimum coverage distance is obtained around ~200-425 m, which maximises the supported throughput per km 2 . However, results for the profit in percentage indicates that coverage distances in the range 395-425 m should be used in BCC.","['Fernando J. Velez', 'Nuno Anastacio', 'Francisco Merca', 'O.

The fault-intolerant initial system consists of a set of independent periodic tasks scheduled onto a set of fail-silent processors. We transform the tasks such that, assuming the availability of an additional spare processor, the system tolerates one failure at a time (transient or permanent). Failure detection is implemented using heartbeating, and failure masking using checkpointing and roll-back. These techniques are described and implemented by automatic program transformations on the tasks' programs. The proposed formal approach to fault-tolerance by program transformation highlights the benefits of separation of concerns and allows us to establish correctness properties.","['Tolga Ayav', 'Pascal Fradet', 'Alain Girault']",11,"['0f785058-a24b-4945-835a-b15f7fd8825f', '10ea52d8-56d3-4506-aab7-b1b64f5344c8', '11f52fe3-4eca-4818-9bcf-9e24cdc76fb5', '1e9be5a4-be09-4c3c-93cb-196a71f9f784', '238a4c4c-4327-463d-86e0-2a4714e3c3e1', '23c82e3b-76e3-401a-835b-7b7cc9e708c0', '2e05a0b2-60f0-4f56-bce8-cbc7134b16d2', '3d8e75cd-eec3-4ab5-b285-92586cff43b6', '483abfd0-ae5f-49a0-81ab-aab92c9e6009', '4fbe420c-8d2c-49f3-99f0-333e4d4d61c9', '533251b5-d3a7-41ef-a6f0-c7c436e30d50', '652953ef-3edd-42e0-9386-42045e48b762', '6d173426-93bd-41ee-812e-3e3d0ab65edd', '7ffec2f8-420b-43cf-8ad5-550e332f5d6d', '8b495c61-ea6e-4c7b-9b45-3121ab994aa8', 'c34ecdb4-5868-471d-be76-90f095a8777a', 'c73c10aa-9100-49ca-bb95-b04ad6fecd50', 'ca90e1a8-0ecb-4d3a-8d33-ba139c6459e0', 'd0a52a60-42dd-4d7d-8ff4-a2fa56e696fc', 'df7db2f4-412c-4e36-8530-94a4c89ad546']",Implementing fault-tolerance in real-time systems by automatic program transformations,embedded software,2006,4acc443a-2821-4842-b558-80ae6490b98d

"Overtaking and lane changing are very dangerous driving maneuvers due to possible driver distraction and blind spots. We propose an aid system based on image processing to help the driver in these situations. The main purpose of an overtaking monitoring system is to segment the rear view and track the overtaking vehicle. We address this task with an optic-flow-driven scheme, focusing on the visual field in the side mirror by placing a camera on top of it. When driving a car, the ego-motion optic-flow pattern is very regular, i.e., all the static objects (such as trees, buildings on the roadside, or landmarks) move backwards. An overtaking vehicle, on the other hand, generates an optic-flow pattern in the opposite direction, i.e., moving forward toward the vehicle. This well-structured motion scenario facilitates the segmentation of regular motion patterns that correspond to the overtaking vehicle. Our approach is based on two main processing stages: First, the computation of optical flow in real time uses a customized digital signal processor (DSP) particularly designed for this task and, second, the tracking stage itself, based on motion pattern analysis, which we address using a standard processor. We present a validation benchmark scheme to evaluate the viability and robustness of the system using a set of overtaking vehicle sequences to determine a reliable vehicle-detection distance.","['J.

"There are four fundamental aspects of use and reuse in building systems from components: conceptualization, retrieval, selection and correct use. The most important barrier to use and reuse is that of conceptualization. The Inscape environment is a specification-based software development environment integrated by the constructive use of formal interface specifications. The purpose of the formal interface specifications and the semantic interconnections is to make explicit the invisible semantic dependencies that result in conventionally-built systems. The important ingredient provided by Inquire in conceptualization, retrieval, selection and use is the set of predicates that describe the semantics of the elements in the interface. These predicates define the abstractions that are germane to the module interface and describe the properties of data objects and the assumptions and results of operations in a module. Use and reuse of components is based on a component's ability to provide needed semantics at a particular point in a system.

Traveling at constant speed, the agents achieve and maintain their formation by using small steering adjustments to equalize the distance between themselves and their respective leading and following neighbors. Since the formation moves around a common loop, an agent can move forward or back in formation by respectively steering slighting inside or outside the reference loop. These adjustments are controlled with the use of variable radius parameters for each agent that are shown to converge to the desired reference loop as equal spacing is achieved. We show that the proposed controller renders the desired formation locally asymptotically stable and provide simulations to demonstrate the performance of the controller for an example scenario in which the formation must recover from the loss of an agent.","['James R.

"The group decision-making framework with linguistic preference relations is studied. In this context, we assume that there exist several experts who may have different background and knowledge to solve a particular problem and, therefore, different linguistic term sets (multigranular linguistic information) could be used to express their opinions. The aim of this paper is to present a model of consensus support system to assist the experts in all phases of the consensus reaching process of group decision-making problems with multigranular linguistic preference relations. This consensus support system model is based on i) a multigranular linguistic methodology, ii) two consensus criteria, consensus degrees and proximity measures, and iii) a guidance advice system. The multigranular linguistic methodology permits the unification of the different linguistic domains to facilitate the calculus of consensus degrees and proximity measures on the basis of experts' opinions. The consensus degrees assess the agreement amongst all the experts' opinions, while the proximity measures are used to find out how far the individual opinions are from the group opinion. The guidance advice system integrated in the consensus support system model acts as a feedback mechanism, and it is based on a set of advice rules to help the experts change their opinions and to find out which direction that change should follow in order to obtain the highest degree of consensus possible. There are two main advantages provided by this model of consensus support system. Firstly, its ability to cope with group decision-making problems with multigranular linguistic preference relations, and, secondly, the figure of the moderator, traditionally presents in the consensus reaching process, is replaced by the guidance advice system, and in such a way, the whole group decision-making process is automated","['Enrique Herrera-Viedma', 'L.

"Petri net has been widely used for modeling software systems due to its mathematical soundness and support of various tools. In many cases, performance-related analyses of Petri net for a software system need to consider the resource limitations caused by a specific platform. In terms of aspect-oriented approach, the interference of various resources scattered across a software system can be regarded as a specific concern that is only necessary during its performance-related analysis process. To capture the interactions of resources within the Petri net-based software architectural model, we propose an aspect-oriented resource composition model and the XML-based representation language called the resource extension markup language (ReML) for its description. In our approach, one or more resource composition models can be developed and described in ReML separately from the development of base software architectural models. Through the weaving process, a resource composition model can be applied to extend several Petri net-based software architectural models. The resource weaver generates an augmented Petri net used for analyzing performance characteristics of the extended software architectural model with resource interactions. Our aspect-oriented approach facilitates selecting an optimal or superior resource composition model for a software architectural model, and vice versa, which is illustrated using two exemplary server models.","['Tae-Hyung Kim', 'Carl K.

A theory of concept (Galois) lattices was first introduced by Wille. An extension of his work to simple structures called concept sublattices has also been published. This paper shows that concept sublattices can be applied to (i) determining subsumption of specifications and (ii) decomposing specifications in terms of others. I show that the latter application of the theory may provide us with new conceptualizations of a specification.,['Janos J.

Coordination between the control center and the areas is accomplished via data networks subject to communication latency which is modelled by time-varying time-delay.

"The effects of an attack connection can propagate quickly to different parts of an all-optical transparent network. Such attacks affect the normal traffic and can either cause service degradation or outright service denial. Quick detection and localization of an attack source can avoid losing large amounts of data in an all-optical network. Attack monitors can collect the information from connections and nodes for diagnostic purpose. However, to detect attack sources, it is not necessary to put monitors at all nodes. Since those connections affected by the attack connection would provide valuable information for diagnosis, we show that by placing a relatively small number of monitors on a selected set of nodes in a network is sufficient to achieve the required level of performance. However, the actual monitor placement, routing, and attack diagnosis are challenging problems that need research attention. In this paper, we first develop our models of crosstalk attack and monitor node. With these models, we prove the necessary and sufficient condition for one-crosstalk-attack diagnosable networks. Next, we develop a scalable diagnosis method which can localize the attack connection efficiently with sparse monitor nodes in the network.","['Tao Wu', 'Arun K.

"VoIP conferencing with a centralized speech mixing bridge introduces additional end-to-end latency into packetized voice communication. This paper investigates how full tandem speech decoding, time-domain mixing, speech encoding cycle can be circumvented by instead extracting the coded speech parameters and performing the speech packet mixing without time-domain reconstruction. By mixing through coded speech parameters, we show that nearly an 85% decrease in computational complexity can be achieved over full tandem mixing of two speakers for G.722.2, thus significantly reducing the packet latency at the centralized speech mixing bridge. For the G.722.2 parametric mixer presented, linear prediction coefficients (LPCs), pitch lags, fixed codebooks, and gains, are extracted (without full speech reconstruction) from the encoded bit stream, mixed, and then re-encoded instead of the full tandem approach where each speech frame must be fully reconstructed. We investigate the mixing in two scenarios: i) mix two 12.65 kbps G.722.2 speech streams at a mixed rate of 12.65 kbps, and ii) mix two 12.65 kbps G.722.2 speech streams at a mixed rate of 18.25 kbps. PAMS is used to evaluate the speech quality of the parametric mixer, resulting in an average distortion of 0.37 MOS (compared to tandem mixing) as shown by simulations using typical conversation models.","['Giuseppe Agnello', 'Richard M.

"A likely trend in the development of future CAD, CASE and office information systems will be the use of object-oriented database systems to manage their internal data stores. The entities that these applications will retrieve, such as electronic parts and their connections or customer service records, are typically large complex objects composed of many interconnected heterogeneous objects, not thousands of tuples. These applications may exhibit widely shifting usage patterns due to their interactive mode of operation. Such a class of applications would demand clustering methods that are appropriate for clustering large complex objects and that can adapt on-line to the shifting usage patterns. While most object-oriented clustering methods allow grouping of heterogeneous objects, they  are usually static and can only be changed off-line. We present one possible architecture for performing complex object reclustering in an on-line manner that is adaptive to changing usage patterns. Our architecture involves the decomposition of a clustering method into concurrently operating components that each handle one of the fundamental tasks involved in reclustering, namely statistics collection, cluster analysis, and reorganization. We present the results of an experiment performed to evaluate its behavior. These results show that the average miss rate for object accesses can be effectively reduced using a combination of rules that we have developed for deciding when cluster analyses and reorganizations should be performed.","['William J.

"Reference immutability ensures that a reference is not used to modify the referenced object, and enables the safe sharing of object structures. A pure method does not cause side-effects on the objects that existed in the pre-state of the method execution.

In addition, we present a novel application of the reference immutability type system: method purity inference.   To support our theoretical results, we implemented the type system and the type inference analysis for Java. We include a type checker to verify the correctness of the inference result.

This is done by allowing each solution to generate more than one offspring but using a different mutation operator which combines information of the best solution in the population and also information of the current parent to find new search directions. Three selection criteria based on feasibility are used to deal with the constraints of the problem and also a diversity mechanism is added to maintain infeasible solutions located in promising areas of the search space.

"WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) is a wireless access technology that aims to provide last mile wireless broadband access for fixed and mobile users as an alternative to the wired DSL and cable access. It is specified in the IEEE 802.16 standard. The standard defines several possible bandwidth request methods that can be implemented in an actual deployment of a WiMAX network. In this paper, we will study the performance of two different bandwidth request mechanisms, namely piggyback and broadcast requests and will show in which situations piggybacking performs better than the contention based broadcast bandwidth requests.","['Rastin Pries', 'Dirk Staehle', 'Daniel Marsico']",50,"['86010eaa-efd6-4530-b763-761947f90ad3', 'db09dc61-fd58-4619-ba4a-7cb059496f85', 'e63f621e-f3cf-4add-9d55-240da9ebae5c']",Performance Evaluation of Piggyback Requests in IEEE 802.16,vehicular technology conference,2007,4acdd824-6275-4247-bc56-035b64acbbac
"This paper presents mobile robot localization using coded infrared light as artificial landmarks. Different from RFID, identification using infrared light has highly deterministic characteristics. IRID(infrared identification) is implemented with IR LEDs and photo transistors. By putting several infrared LEDs on the ceiling, the floor is divided into several sectors and each sector is set to have a unique identification. The coded infrared light tells which sector the robot is in, but the size of the uncertainty is still too large if the sector size is large, which usually occur. Dead-reckoning provides the estimated robot configuration but the error is getting accumulated as the robot travels. This paper presents an algorithm which fuses both the encoder and the IRID information so that the size of the uncertainty becomes smaller. It also introduces a framework which can be used with other types of the artificial landmarks. The characteristics of the developed IRID and the proposed algorithm are verified from the experiments.","['Soo-Yong Lee', 'Jae-Bok Song']",5,"['18b17dbd-4f51-411e-a099-efadf521f0d8', '1921c2a2-8f91-4e58-820f-bb4e2d6658d6', '238dd1e7-d5c5-48b2-a7a9-8fee722818c5', '3939cb96-d8c8-4ec4-8102-bbce2976aeee', '83bed78b-2751-4a4c-8168-c487c9bab5b4', '8e1e7f4d-7b5f-42e5-b71a-50aeaa325217', '936bc9b7-7671-4320-a093-c0c8a35ee340', 'f8a9df79-9be7-4333-a71c-327040f67fcd']",Use of coded infrared light as artificial landmarks for mobile robot localization,intelligent robots and systems,2007,4acde1bd-09b3-4c98-8fe7-807028d7434e

"Kinematics analysis and dimensional synthesis are two important problems of a parallel manipulator. Dimensional synthesis is optimization of the kinematic parameters according to desired workspace or other design requirements. In this paper, the dimensional synthesis of a 3-DOF parallel manipulator, which mimics DELTA robots, is studied considering maximum inscribed workspace and reciprocal of the condition number on the workspace section based on the concept. The kinematic model of the 3-DOF parallel manipulator is given at first. The golden section search is used to search the workspace of the manipulator and mesh the boundary. Then the algorithm for calculating the inscribed workspace and dimensional synthesis considering the inscribed workspace are presented. Thirdly, the distribution of dexterity index on the workspace section and dimensional synthesis considering the reciprocal of condition number is studied. The two dimensional synthesis results are compared at the end of the paper. While the synthesis methodology of the manipulator is studied. It is helpful to improve design efficiency of the 3-DOF parallel manipulator. The quickly design for the manipulator can be performed through the proposed methods of dimensional synthesis.","['Yuan Yun', 'Wnag L', 'Liwen Guan']",10,['6bdd23d3-a03c-4d8c-810a-efd20c68c373'],Dimensional synthesis of a 3-DOF parallel manipulator,"systems, man and cybernetics",2004,4acdfa3c-93ee-4746-9a5f-123cb4280b33
"A tracked robot is designed for destroyed mine search and rescue. The mechanical system is introduced from reconfigurable structure, suspension system and anti- explosive and waterproof. The sensors include CCD camera, CO, CH4, temperature and air speed are equipped on the robot. Two pairs of swing arms are equipped on the robot. Their motions help robot climb up obstacle. Because the center of gravity (CG) plays an important role in the process of climbing up an obstacle, the CG kinematics model is built. Using this model, the CG change situation is obtained, and the maximum height of the obstacle which can be climbed up is obtained, and the stability angle margin is obtained too. The relationship between the robot pitch angle and the height of the obstacle is obtained. Using this relationship, the geometry parameter of the uncertain environment can be known. These analysis help to design and control the robot.","['Weidong Wang', 'Zhijiang Du', 'Lining Sun']",5,"['41af2fa7-8fd6-4f3d-b075-42befa110c98', 'b8d0e0cc-caba-4dc3-bd80-04c6725db145', 'd8ddb6bc-5ae6-4389-8ff0-9ef129a10fdf', 'e9a03f89-6eda-4fbd-bf3f-28ed575b1df7']",Kinematics analysis for obstacle-climbing performance of a rescue robot,robotics and biomimetics,2007,4ace1821-dcc6-4766-be85-3b775d41b42a
"Software evolves to fix bugs and add features. Stopping and restarting programs to apply changes is inconvenient and often costly. Dynamic software updating (DSU) addresses this problem by updating programs while they execute, but existing DSU systems for managed languages do not support many updates that occur in practice and are inefficient. This paper presents the design and implementation of J volve , a DSU-enhanced Java VM. Updated programs may add, delete, and replace fields and methods anywhere within the class hierarchy. Jvolve implements these updates by adding to and coordinating VM classloading, just-in-time compilation, scheduling, return barriers, on-stack replacement, and garbage collection. J volve , is  safe : its use of bytecode verification and VM thread synchronization ensures that an update will always produce type-correct executions. Jvolve is  flexible : it can support 20 of 22 updates to three open-source programs--Jetty web server, JavaEmailServer, and CrossFTP server--based on actual releases occurring over 1 to 2 years. Jvolve is  efficient : performance experiments show that incurs  no overhead  during steady-state execution. These results demonstrate that this work is a significant step towards practical support for dynamic updates in virtual machines for managed languages.","['Suriya Subramanian', 'Michael Hicks', 'Kathryn S.

"Ensembles are a set of classification models that, when combined, produce better predictions than when used by themselves. This chapter proposes a new evolutionary algorithm-based method for creating an ensemble of rule sets consisting of two stages. First, an evolutionary algorithm (more precisely, a genetic programming algorithm) is used to automatically create complete rule induction algorithms. Secondly, the automatically-evolved rule induction algo- rithms are used to produce rule sets that are then combined into an ensemble. Concerning this second stage, we investigate the effectiveness of two different approaches for combining the votes of all rule sets in the ensemble and two dif- ferent approaches for selecting which subset of evolved rule induction algorithms (out of all evolved algorithms) should be used to produce the rule sets that will be combined into an ensemble.","['Gisele L.

"We propose an approach using artificial neural networks to classify masses in mammograms as malignant or benign. Single- layer and multilayer perceptron networks are used in a study on perceptron topologies and training procedures for pattern classifica- tion of breast masses. The contours of a set of 111 regions on mam- mograms related to breast masses and tumors are manually delin- eated and represented by polygonal models for shape analysis. Ribbons of pixels are extracted around the boundaries of a subset of 57 masses by dilating and eroding the contours. Three shape fac- tors, three measures of edge sharpness, and 14 texture features based on gray-level co-occurrence matrices of the pixels in the rib- bons are computed. Several combinations of the features are used with perceptrons of varying topology and training procedures for the classification of benign masses and malignant tumors. The results are compared in terms of the area Az under the receiver operating characteristics curve. Values of Az up to 0.99 are obtained with the shape factors and texture features. However, only feature sets that included at least one shape factor provide consistently high perfor- mance with respect to variations in network topology and training.","['Túlio César Soares dos Santos André', 'Rangaraj M.

"With the increasingly diverse and complex requirements of radar systems and communication systems, the application of multifunction-phased array radar has become a trend, and the digital multi-beamforming technology plays a crucial role in it. In practice, power amplifier (PA) is an essential component in radar systems and communication systems. Unfortunately, it is always nonlinear to provide a high output power. With the purpose of a high output power and efficiency, it is necessary to study the influence of PA nonlinear characteristics on the digital multi-beamforming. In this paper, a form of the multi-beamforming signal and a nonlinear model with memory for PA are given. The output signal via the PA model has been analyzed subsequently. As the result of analysis, it can be found that the output signal is divided into the original signal and the interferential signal. The power ratio of original signal to interference signal can reflect the influence of PA nonlinear characteristics on the digital multi-beamforming. Finally, according to the ratio, the results of computer simulation show that the memory effect plays a key role for the small power signal, while the nonlinearity plays an important role for the large power signal.","['Huiyong Li', 'Xun Li', 'Chen Wei']",0,['fcfa863c-a725-4d8d-90b5-b9a22f0131a7'],The analysis of the performance of multi-beamforming in memory nonlinear power amplifier,EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing,2014,4ace878f-961a-4a3e-95df-dba3f29f67c2
"Multi-topology routing is an increasingly popular IP network management concept that allows transport of different traffic types over disjoint network paths. The concept is of particular interest for implementation of IP fast reroute (IP FRR). First, it can support guaranteed, instantaneous recovery from any link or node failure. Second, different failures result in routing over different network topologies, which augments the parameter space for load distribution optimizations. Multiple routing configurations (MRC) is the state-of-the-art IP FRR scheme based on multi-topology routing today. In this paper we present a new, enhanced IP FRR scheme which we call ldquorelaxed MRCrdquo (rMRC). rMRC simplifies the topology construction and increases the routing flexibility in each topology. According to our experimental evaluation, rMRC has several benefits compared to MRC.

"We study local, distributed algorithms for the capacitated minimum dominating set (CapMDS) problem, which arises in various distributed network applications. Given a network graph  G  = ( V,E ), and a capacity  cap(v)  ∈  N  for each node  v  ∈  V  , the CapMDS problem asks for a subset  S  ⊆  V  of minimal cardinality, such that every network node not in  S  is covered by at least one neighbor in  S , and every node  v  ∈  S  covers at most  cap(v)  of its neighbors. We prove that in general graphs and even with uniform capacities, the problem is inherently  non-local , i.e., every distributed algorithm achieving a non-trivial approximation ratio must have a time complexity that essentially grows linearly with the network diameter. On the other hand, if for some parameter e > 0, capacities can be violated by a factor of 1 + e, CapMDS becomes much more local. Particularly, based on a novel distributed randomized rounding technique, we present a distributed bi-criteria algorithm that achieves an O(log Δ)-approximation in time O(log 3  n  + log( n )/e), where  n  and Δ denote the number of nodes and the maximal degree in  G , respectively. Finally, we prove that in geometric network graphs typically arising in wireless settings, the uniform problem can be approximated within a constant factor in logarithmic time, whereas the non-uniform problem remains entirely non-local.","['Fabian Kuhn', 'Thomas Moscibroda']",50,"['012f1cae-37e1-47ef-b9d1-1b383688be93', '062b3340-3396-4b31-998f-f6e875e220e8', '07f78c4a-29c7-4311-bc75-358e5e834f60', '0cb05af8-9a49-43d9-80b8-421461ad5150', '0eecca15-260e-458c-aa1a-71416e35f10f', '0fe4b5ab-a925-454a-b20f-bcd9de995ede', '13cbd7fe-7f89-49a5-b001-9b7ac8a89451', '23dd7fc0-1ebd-43ce-ab3e-43896512c209', '40bab7cd-76d6-4f12-9128-9025cd0697ec', '42504d0c-f584-4880-afa9-05732e871b54', '43257a5c-06e9-490f-90ae-7a8ded58c3ee', '43ef5e52-8575-4a33-8a8c-40bf12bad7aa', '5206c217-1841-40ae-b9ac-67d246acd0ae', '6ae6d563-b2af-4866-9453-ea32e64f1e94', '71c2bdc7-ecad-4e68-838a-b5daa3b01ba0', '798b5e4a-720c-40c0-a6ad-664bd9130d5a', '810e859b-9499-4d57-8103-63010243f5a3', '9ea5b51b-0018-4fc1-b2df-06f6029e0f58', 'a790a22b-5281-46cc-8894-073d9908a963', 'b12cd4a9-90c8-41d7-94a1-d9e80a546e3a', 'bb72c9da-7469-4024-86a5-b3b4c7846418', 'c98d046b-6496-4dda-8fbf-75c7888f14f2', 'e91a5fc1-2d79-4755-b861-c239a1ff749e', 'eff2b5f5-b765-423e-afa4-d386778949a2', 'fa153634-8b1e-441c-8995-646b1640039a']",Distributed approximation of capacitated dominating sets,acm symposium on parallel algorithms and architectures,2007,4aceb407-5f23-4676-b6cb-9f50e46b563d

The proposed method utilizes various features including lexical semantic and dependency-based combined features. The experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms a state-of-the-art approach, mainly due to the new strategies.

"Deals with the use of multipass synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data in order to achieve three-dimensional tomography reconstruction in presence of volumetric scattering. Starting from azimuth- and range-focused SAR data relative to the same area, neglecting any mutual interaction between the targets, and assuming the propagation in homogeneous media, we investigate the possibility to focus the data also in the elevation direction. The problem is formulated in the framework of linear inverse problem and the solution makes use of the singular value decomposition of the relevant operator. This allows us to properly take into account nonuniform orbit separation and to exploit a priori knowledge regarding the size of the volume interested by the scattering mechanism, thus leading to superresolution in the elevation direction. Results obtained on simulated data demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed processing technique.","['Gianfranco Fornaro', 'Francesco Serafino', 'Francesco Soldovieri']",212,"['1d2d1d23-4b7f-4cec-b528-13732b4683c1', '4d406a94-4cd9-4be2-9d3e-141f42a6614d', 'a458806c-8bcb-4d1f-8e1d-500bbb1fab7d']",Three-dimensional focusing with multipass SAR data,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,2003,4acebfb4-f7f3-41e6-8dcc-69851660037d

A simple and efficient method for obtaining filters modelling intermediate fractional delays from two Thiran fractional-delay filters is proposed.

We developed a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model and supporting heuristics for optimizing IBM's semiconductor supply chain. We designed three heuristics, driven by practical applications, for capturing the discrete aspects of the MIP.

"Wireless communication at 60GHz, aka mmWave, provides extremely high data rates, i.e., several Gb/s. Moreover, devices have a much shorter transmission range as compared to those operating in the 2.4 and 5GHz bands. Indeed, links can be treated as pseudo-wires with minimal interference leakage. As a result, future 60GHz systems will have very high spatial reuse. This, however, is at the expense of high propagation loss, which can be overcome using directional or smart antennas. Another promising solution is to employ relays to boost the signal of weak links. In particular, if relays are properly selected, they are able to offer higher data rates than direct links, and also help circumvent obstacles. To this end, we review state-of-the-art schedulers that take advantage of the high spatial re-use afforded by 60GHz wireless systems to activate multiple links within a channel time allocation. Moreover, we survey works that use passive and active relays to overcome obstacles and to facilitate novel applications. We also survey those that maximize both spatial reuse and throughput of both direct and indirect (relay) links simultaneously.","['Jian Song', 'Kwan-Wu Chin']",6,"['00d9b5b2-84a4-4340-b0df-8adf839caf59', '06320ab1-1874-4da5-a145-626faf5970ad', '0d4ef048-4af1-49c9-895c-152ebaf3d0c1', '39f07ef6-88c8-4a33-ba06-55bfef71d86e', '40389f2b-14b0-40c5-8ca3-ae086f893c36', '42270dd5-ac3d-4a34-aa5f-ed0c1e66f1a9', '4afcc845-406a-434d-a463-10f1b74175c0', '4c14a811-8089-4137-b8df-020f5fde5caf', '524f49fe-b34d-4839-99dd-21507ca28a16', '52929260-ae68-4948-8ee9-14ef7c308aba', '58b56544-cb3a-4807-8953-d5690ac971f0', '615a0598-f1ad-4cd6-b3fd-5393e1eb7d2d', '61b2ef9c-d40d-4fd5-a0d1-2df61a63bc78', '6748db47-6602-4b5a-812f-6a1983c71611', '6a66cb29-bb6a-4446-9bec-5e7dc0e86271', '702f641d-8217-42e9-87de-3c3f2932af1a', '7f6dd293-bbe1-4ea9-a971-c7822381dbff', '80cd7e77-25b6-4ef8-bcd6-7ee7251afbcf', '86a5a113-ad73-49cd-b714-dcd310184630', '8c90f7f8-bff6-4a42-87bd-7836d11863dc', '8f4aeaaa-fc7e-452a-b326-ef3ea47179ba', '926101ba-46fa-44fd-abf7-cb2da59ea6af', '9515827a-73dc-451b-b51a-f2a7305a6928', '96795c10-ef61-46ab-ad58-c05790a9b357', '99bfbaaf-174f-4f00-8add-6fd1097e31af', '9ef336fd-dec8-49ca-a6e1-5fd8df82f84c', 'a26bb032-6c80-420f-b4bc-e800f2799fd3', 'ac5b9c0e-9adf-461c-ab9f-8bd601224fd6', 'b4021072-94e0-4cef-8794-e28671f87e8e', 'ba7bf877-e26f-4a5a-8010-a0d983ee5429', 'cce68577-fceb-4d41-bec8-3fba2dee9ebe', 'dcee9882-299e-4634-a84a-4f85190bf589', 'e31fd71c-61fa-4b2c-b0ec-596cdaf2fb12', 'e6bfc134-6d75-4d33-ac84-99b2134762f1', 'e7deeaae-f7ec-415a-a630-2fad9f50d321', 'ee237ece-46c3-4be7-ac94-7a033f17ca0e', 'f24f6aa9-7e13-45ca-b9e5-2f23eac02755']",A survey of single and multi-hop link schedulers for mmWave wireless systems,ad hoc networks,2015,4acf2621-813f-45f0-8369-448280e23f49

These government departments, in particular the departments in charge of economic development, pay a great attention to the economic information in their decision-making. There is an urgent demand for efficient decision support systems in macroeconomic decision-making. In this paper we present a data-driven approach for building macroeconomic decision support system. We first give a comprehensive discussion about the basic elements and their data-processing methods for Macroeconomic Decision Support Systems according to China's situation. These elements include: leading indicator system about business cycle, state identification of economic movement, forecasting of economic trend, promotion of successful cases, choice of regulation instruments, evaluation method of macroeconomic policies.

"We propose a packet-level model to investigate the impact of channel error on the transmission control protocol (TCP) performance over IEEE-802.11-based multihop wireless networks. A Markov renewal approach is used to analyze the behavior of TCP Reno and TCP Impatient NewReno. Compared to previous work, our main contributions are listed as follows: 1) modeling multiple lossy links, 2) investigating the interactions among TCP, Internet Protocol (IP), and media access control (MAC) protocol layers, specifically the impact of 802.11 MAC protocol and dynamic source routing (DSR) protocol on TCP throughput performance, 3) considering the spatial reuse property of the wireless channel, the model takes into account the different proportions between the interference range and transmission range, and 4) adopting more accurate and realistic analysis to the fast recovery process and showing the dependency of throughput and the risk of experiencing successive fast retransmits and timeouts on the packet error probability. The analytical results are validated against simulation results by using GloMoSim. The results show that the impact of the channel error is reduced significantly due to the packet retransmissions on a per-hop basis and a small bandwidth delay product of ad hoc networks. The TCP throughput always deteriorates less than ~ 10 percent, with a packet error rate ranging from 0 to 0.1. Our model also provides a theoretical basis for designing an optimum long retry limit for IEEE 802.11 in ad hoc networks.","['Xia Li', 'Peng Yong Kong', 'Kee Chaing Chua']",24,"['01a09d2c-f8d3-40e4-bfee-211533b3f526', '352caa76-f117-4f58-aa90-ea6f7f0472da', '406e899a-9bb1-49a1-b511-7beb182ff0e7', '4854b363-f03e-4667-abad-2de7ca3d2315', '4bd4994c-bb1a-45e6-a757-25050d4941f1', '4e1b16b5-27b8-4cd0-8842-77f7b5576114', '5a4573e9-8929-4a04-b1f2-5f6721fdb673', '775f9305-5317-4aee-bb2d-335df640d3cb', '95db084d-9f52-468d-839e-00be5fdea08a', 'd8bc24a3-0528-4142-9b8f-fc0ec9175366', 'db3abffb-43a7-40e7-9b3d-5b0b4ec7c77f', 'de881047-365b-4c68-a405-1541fa2aaf65', 'df8c16c1-2440-4891-a4f4-93e85177a605', 'e5cbac41-7812-4014-911b-a106c0804fce', 'f65a4365-2696-47f3-849b-501792da7e23']",TCP Performance in IEEE 802.11-Based Ad Hoc Networks with Multiple Wireless Lossy Links,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2007,4acf3aa1-6083-4baf-8312-44d198858b94
"Cloud computing has emerging as a promising pattern for data outsourcing and high-quality data services. However, concerns of sensitive information on cloud potentially causes privacy problems. Data encryption protects data security to some extent, but at the cost of compromised efficiency. Searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) allows retrieval of encrypted data over cloud. In this paper, we focus on addressing data privacy issues using SSE. For the first time, we formulate the privacy issue from the aspect of similarity relevance and scheme robustness. We observe that server-side ranking based on order-preserving encryption (OPE) inevitably leaks data privacy. To eliminate the leakage, we propose a two-round searchable encryption (TRSE) scheme that supports top-k multikeyword retrieval. In TRSE, we employ a vector space model and homomorphic encryption. The vector space model helps to provide sufficient search accuracy, and the homomorphic encryption enables users to involve in the ranking while the majority of computing work is done on the server side by operations only on ciphertext. As a result, information leakage can be eliminated and data security is ensured. Thorough security and performance analysis show that the proposed scheme guarantees high security and practical efficiency.","['Jiadi Yu', 'Peng Lu', 'Yanmin Zhu', 'Guangtao Xue', 'Minglu Li']",120,"['0195c172-2b91-4921-add4-3c5ad8251f6a', '0d18ea11-c8df-4984-a797-5e94506666b7', '109c05fe-b379-4944-a425-8474e0fb2863', '2446c280-cb69-4413-9358-930b5be9c243', '2b63d122-e76d-4d94-a376-2424a64e3de6', '36f9eeaa-7685-4a12-a3b6-d3fad691da4a', '3cf4ab2c-bd79-435f-9e56-b4561fe50f74', '406bfd32-2d17-48b0-834b-8420b725fe45', '40d4d2fd-fe64-4d0a-824d-a253cd8eecad', '83dd4552-f05e-4388-a928-bcaa1f4deb81', '9f33558a-7887-4a55-98bb-761f880f0d3a', 'a471a828-9640-4de7-9603-0c851bcb4810', 'aeac2476-6970-4b54-8ec2-6d83fac61ae6']",Toward Secure Multikeyword Top-k Retrieval over Encrypted Cloud Data,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,2013,4acf3ffb-2e68-4359-970c-8b59ac66c9ac
"We design constellation labeling maps for bit-interleaved space-time coded modulation with iterative decoding (BI-STCM-ID) over Rayleigh block-fading channels using the Alamouti scheme and N/sub r/ receive antennas. To achieve the largest asymptotic coding gain from the constellation labeling, we propose a new design criterion that maximizes the (-2N/sub r/)-th power mean of the squared Euclidean distances associated with all ""error-free feedback"" events in the constellation. Based on this power mean criterion, we show that the labeling optimization problem falls into the category of quadratic assignment problems. We propose two novel 16-QAM labeling maps that are particularly designed for N/sub r/=1 and N/sub r/=2, respectively. Numerical results show that both labeling maps achieve about 1 dB coding gain over the conventional 16-QAM modified set partitioning labeling.","['Yuheng Huang', 'James A.

"In this paper, the    $\eta $   -Nash equilibrium (   $\eta $   -NE) region of the two-user Gaussian interference channel (IC) with perfect output feedback is approximated to within 1 bit/s/Hz and    $\eta $    arbitrarily close to 1 bit/s/Hz. The relevance of the    $\eta $   -NE region is that it provides the set of rate pairs that are achievable and stable in the IC when both transmitter–receiver pairs autonomously tune their own transmit–receive configurations seeking an    $\eta $   -optimal individual transmission rate. Therefore, any rate tuple outside the    $\eta $   -NE region is not stable as there always exists one link able to increase by at least    $\eta $    bits/s/Hz its own transmission rate by updating its own transmit–receive configuration. The main insights that arise from this paper are as follows. First, the    $\eta $   -NE region achieved with feedback is larger than or equal to the    $\eta $   -NE region without feedback. More importantly, for each rate pair achievable at an    $\eta $   -NE without feedback, there exists at least one rate pair achievable at an    $\eta $   -NE with feedback that is weakly Pareto superior. Second, there always exists an    $\eta $   -NE transmit–receive configuration that achieves a rate pair that is at most 1 bit/s/Hz per user away from the outer bound of the capacity region.","['Samir Medina Perlaza', 'Ravi Tandon', 'H.

"This paper describes an environment for the design, simulation, and control of Internet-based force-reflecting telerobotic systems. We define these systems as using a segment of the computer network to connect the master to the slave.

Thus, known techniques for controlling time-delay telerobots are not directly applicable, and an environment for iterative designing and testing is necessary. The underlying software architecture sup ports tools for modeling the delay of the computer network, design ing a stable controller, simulating the performance of a telerobotic system, and testing the control algorithms using a force-reflecting input device.

"In the flip-chip assembly process, no-flow underfill materials have a particular advantage over traditional underfill: the application and curing of the former can be undertaken before and during the reflow process. This advantage can be exploited to increase the flip-chip manufacturing throughput. However, adopting a no-flow underfill process may introduce reliability issues such as underfill entrapment, delamination at interfaces between underfill and other materials, and lower solder joint fatigue life. This paper presents an analysis on the assembly and the reliability of flip-chips with no-flow underfill. The methodology adopted in the work is a combination of experimental and computer-modeling methods. Two types of no-flow underfill materials have been used for the flip chips. The samples have been inspected with X-ray and scanning acoustic microscope inspection systems to find voids and other defects. Eleven samples for each type of underfill material have been subjected to thermal shock test and the number of cycles to failure for these flip chips have been found. In the computer modeling part of the work, a comprehensive parametric study has provided details on the relationship between the material properties and reliability, and on how underfill entrapment may affect the thermal–mechanical fatigue life of flip chips with no-flow underfill.","['Hua Lu', 'K.C.

"Research in human-computer interaction has begun to acknowledge the benefits of physicality in the way people interact with computers. However, the role of physicality is often understood in terms of the characteristics of physical smart objects and their digital augmentation. We are stressing that the physicality lies within the interaction, not the object, and use a subset of bodily actions, exertion interactions, as an example to demonstrate our point. Emerging game designs have shown that supporting such exertion interactions can enable beneficial experiences between geographically distant participants. Based on several designs from our own work as well as others in this area we articulate reflections for the design of systems that support and facilitate bodily aspects of physicality in networked environments. We believe our work can serve as guidance for designers who are interested in creating future systems that support networked exertion interactions.","[""Florian 'Floyd' Mueller"", 'Martin R.

"The process interaction world view is widely used in the general simulation community for its expressive power, and is supported by most modern simulation languages. In parallel discrete event simulation, however, its use remains comparatively rare due to the perceived inefficiency (and difficulty) of parallel implementations.We present a new implementation strategy for parallel process-oriented simulation languages. This innovative, semantics-based approach directly addresses two common concerns of such languages. By concentrating on the intrinsic threads of control, we avoid the proliferation of simulation objects (and their associated costs) that might result from a naive translation. More fundamentally, the primary costs associated with process-oriented languages -- those of context switching between stacks and, in an optimistic setting, of saving the state of these stacks -- are entirely eliminated since our explicit use of continuations avoids the need for stacks in the first place. We similarly obtain cheap and natural thread preemption.","['Chris J. M. Booth', 'Donald I.

"This paper proposes a method for progressive lossy-to-lossless compression of four-dimensional (4-D) medical images (sequences of volumetric images over time) by using a combination of three-dimensional (3-D) integer wavelet transform (IWT) and 3-D motion compensation. A 3-D extension of the set-partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) algorithm is employed for coding the wavelet coefficients. To effectively exploit the redundancy between consecutive 3-D images, the concepts of key and residual frames from video coding is used. A fast 3-D cube matching algorithm is employed to do motion estimation. The key and the residual volumes are then coded using 3-D IWT and the modified 3-D SPIHT. The experimental results presented in this paper show that our proposed compression scheme achieves better lossy and lossless compression performance on 4-D medical images when compared with JPEG-2000 and volumetric compression based on 3-D SPIHT.","['Ashraf A.

"A multiuser communication system is considered where K users share a channel with multipath propagation by using code division for multiple access. Data modulation is carried out by binary phase shift keying and direct sequence spread spectrum signaling. The micro-cellular communication media is modeled as a frequency selective fading channel with multipath propagation. The multipath diversity of the received signals from the K users is exploited by a bank of K RAKE correlators. Algorithms based on the maximum likelihood rule have been developed for estimating the complex channel coefficients as well as for detection of the desired data packets from the sufficient statistics provided by the RAKE correlators. The performance of the resulting multiuser detector is evaluated analytically and via Monte Carlo simulations. The results indicate that the estimator of the channel coefficients has a variance close to the Cramer-Rao lower bound, and that the proposed multiuser detector is capable of eliminating the near-far effect as well as processing the signals propagated through multiple paths. >","['Urs Fawer', 'Behnaam Aazhang']",179,"['091566c7-8629-4e06-b4e0-582cd0616b39', '10cbf04e-5ccc-4251-8d5e-66a113376c8a', '447c5619-5915-4d3e-87a8-ad439a519f64', '48041e52-9418-4ff4-a9ae-9d326107d67d', '49ed6e29-b657-4b7a-aacb-5906ec46a2c8', '5b50a465-ca87-4ea9-ab06-d8503241123d', '672db936-9f6d-4606-b831-2f7f6da6b37d', '6fc115f8-323a-4999-9e23-c0af2d8973a3', '7f281ff6-53aa-44ce-af72-7c40907738cb', 'ba9f9fb8-272b-4328-baa2-63f26c1ba5e1', 'bb10647f-ca86-468a-9503-01922c4905bf', 'c3911112-7486-4aca-b200-8b6b024a3412', 'd9ac6b03-873f-4350-8acd-7fc840d6a11c', 'f6508273-3fc3-4e90-a0be-5b26ad6ff857', 'f935e82f-ae46-4af1-9d4a-cefa69d9f61c']",A multiuser receiver for code division multiple access communications over multipath channels,IEEE Transactions on Communications,1995,4acfc871-e105-47d4-be5b-85d008d13cf8
"Recently, we proposed a method for constructing a template for efficient temporal synchronization in video watermarking. 1 Our temporal synchronization method uses a state machine key generator for producing the watermark embedded in successive frames of video. A feature extractor allows the watermark key schedule to be content dependent, increasing the difficulty of copy and ownership attacks. It was shown that efficient synchronization can be achieved by adding temporal redundancy into the key schedule. In this paper, we explore and extend the concepts of our temporal synchronization method to spatial synchronization. The key generator is used to construct the embedded watermark of non-overlapping blocks of the video, creating a tiled structure. 2–4 The autocorrelation of the tiled watermark contains local maxima or peaks with a grid-like structure, where the distance between the peaks indicates the scale of the watermark and the orientation of the peaks indicate the watermark rotation. Experimental results are obtained using digital image watermarks. Scaling and rotation attacks are investigated.","['Eugene T. Lin', 'Edward J.

"In the area of fault analysis, SDG (Signed Directed Graph) models can be used to describe the system states and the fault propagation paths which are the composition of qualitative deviation from the normal state. In control systems, besides the natural relations caused by the physical properties, the forced control actions determine the dynamic properties of the systems, which cause the particularity of SDG model-based analysis. In this paper, the SDG description and the analysis methods of fault propagation in control systems are presented, and the typical cases like PID control, feedforward control, split-range control, cascade control etc are illustrated. A graphical analysis method is proposed to substitute the algebraic methods based on equations. These results can be expanded to various control systems and even be applied to large-scale industrial systems by the combination and connection of several basic elements.","['Fan Yang', 'Sirish L.

"Following the methodology established byPrice, this paper analyzes the empirical evidence of citation matrices. Using the data cleaned and tabulated by Computer Horizons, Inc. from the Science Citation Index data banks, it is shown that the non-diagonal elements of the square citation matrices can be accounted for very satisfactorily by assigning each nation a characteristic output and input coefficient in each field measured; the ratio of these coefficients provides a measure of quality. Deviations from this simple model give measures of particular linkage strengths between nations showing some evidence of preferences and avoidances that exist for reason of language, social structure, etc. It is also shown that the diagonal data can be accounted for by the measurable phenomenon that each nation seems to publish partly for the international knowledge system and party for its own domestic purposes.

"Distributed optical fiber sensors have gained an increasingly prominent role in structural-health monitoring. These are composed of an optical fiber cable in which a light impulse is launched by an opto-electronic device. The scattered light is of interest in the spectral domain: the spontaneous Brillouin spectrum is centered on the Brillouin frequency, which is related to the local strain and temperature changes in the optical fiber. When coupled with an industrial Brillouin optical time-domain analyzer (B-OTDA), an optical fiber cable can provide distributed measurements of strain and/or temperature, with a spatial resolution over kilometers of 40 cm. This paper focuses on the functioning of a B-OTDA device, where we address the problem of the improvement of spatial resolution. We model a Brillouin spectrum measured within an integration base of 1 m as the superposition of the elementary spectra contained in the base. Then, the spectral distortion phenomenon can be mathematically explained: if the strain is not constant within the integration base, the Brillouin spectrum is composed of several elementary spectra that are centered on different local Brillouin frequencies. We propose a source separation methodology approach to decompose a measured Brillouin spectrum into its spectral components. The local Brillouin frequencies and amplitudes are related to a portion of the integration base where the strain is constant. A layout algorithm allows the estimation of a strain profile with new spatial resolution chosen by the user. Numerical tests enable the finding of the optimal parameters, which provides a reduction to 1 cm of the 40-cm spatial resolution of the B-OTDA device. These parameters are highlighted during a comparison with a reference strain profile acquired by a 5-cm-resolution Rayleigh scatter analyzer under controlled conditions. In comparison with the B-OTDA strain profile, our estimated strain profile has better accuracy, with centimeter spatial resolution.","['Edouard Buchoud', 'Valeriu Vrabie', 'Jérôme I.

"It has been proposed that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) discovered by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) account for only a small fraction of the genetic variation of complex traits in human population. The remaining unexplained variance or missing heritability is thought to be due to marginal effects of many loci with small effects and has eluded attempts to identify its sources. Combination of different studies appears to resolve in part this problem. However, neither individual GWAS nor meta-analytic combinations thereof are helpful for disclosing which genetic variants contribute to explain a particular phenotype. Here, we propose that most of the missing heritability is latent in the GWAS data, which conceals intermediate phenotypes. To uncover such latent information, we propose the PGMRA server that introduces phenomics—the full set of phenotype features of an individual—to identify SNP-set structures in a broader sense, i.e. causally cohesive genotype‐ phenotype relations. These relations are agnostically identified (without considering disease status of the subjects) and organized in an interpretable fashion. Then, by incorporating a posteriori the subject status within each relation, we can establish the risk surface of a disease in an unbiased mode. This approach complements—instead of replaces— current analysis methods.

"In the robot navigation problem, noisy sensor data must be filtered to obtain the best estimate of the robot position. The discrete Kalman filter, which usually is used for prediction and detection of signals in communication and control problems has become a commonly used method to reduce the effect of uncertainty from the sensor data. However, due to the special domain of robot navigation, the Kalman approach is very limited. The use of total least squares filter has been proposed (Boley and Sutherland, 1993) which is capable of converging with many fewer readings and achieving greater accuracy than the classical Kalman filter. The main disadvantage of those approaches is that they can not deal with the case where the noise subspace is of dimension higher than one. Here a parallel Krylov subspace method on parallel distributed memory computers which uses the Lanczos bidiagonalization process with updating techniques is proposed which is more computationally attractive to solve the total least squares problems. The parallel algorithm is derived such that all inner products of a single iteration step are independent. Therefore, the cost of global communication which represents the bottleneck of the parallel performance on parallel distributed memory computers can be significantly reduced. This filter is very promising for very large data information and from our very preliminary experiments we can obtain more precise accuracy and better speedup.",['Laurence T.

"Maintenance of causality information in distributed systems has previously been implemented in the communications infrastructure with the focus on providing reliability and availability for distributed services. While this approach has a number of advantages, moving causality information up into the view and control of the application programmer is useful, and in some cases, preferable. In an experiment at the University of Queensland, libraries to support application-level maintenance of causality information have been implemented. The libraries allow the collection and use of causality information under programmer control, supplying a basis for making causal dependency information available for application management and troubleshooting. The libraries are also unique in supporting existing distributed systems based on the remote procedure call paradigm. This paper describes the underlying theory of causality, and the design and implementation of the libraries.

"An iterative block training method for support vector classifiers (SVCs) based on weighted least squares (WLS) optimization is presented. The algorithm, which minimizes structural risk in the primal space, is applicable to both linear and nonlinear machines. In some nonlinear cases, it is necessary to previously find a projection of data onto an intermediate-dimensional space by means of either principal component analysis or clustering techniques. The proposed approach yields very compact machines, the complexity reduction with respect to the SVC solution is especially notable in problems with highly overlapped classes. Furthermore, the formulation in terms of WLS minimization makes the development of adaptive SVCs straightforward, opening up new fields of application for this type of model, mainly online processing of large amounts of (static/stationary) data, as well as online update in nonstationary scenarios (adaptive solutions). The performance of this new type of algorithm is analyzed by means of several simulations.","['Ángel Navia-Vázquez', 'Fernando Perez-Cruz', 'Antonio Artés-Rodríguez', 'Aníbal R.

"The rapid growth of routing tables represents a major challenge facing the scalability of BGP and indeed the whole Internet infrastructure. In this paper, we introduce a novel distributed algorithmic scheme for partitioning the BGP routing table on multiple controller cards, where we exploit parallelism to enhance both the lookup speed and the scalability of the RIB (Routing Information Base). The proposed scheme increases the lookup performance by letting unrelated tasks, such as the Best Match Prefix (BMP) lookup and the BGP decision process to be executed in parallel at different controller cards. Simulations show that our proposal outperforms classical central lookup mechanisms with a reasonably acceptable cost, while it increases considerably the space scalability of the BGP routing table.","['Wissam Hamzeh', 'Abdelhakim Hafid Hafid']",1,"['0a50a0a9-439e-43c0-aaa3-561fce1cd16f', '6ade5384-6c44-4511-a4b3-f02535ab1f2b', '9585a57e-55ed-42ed-8c4c-4aa6965f59cc', 'adac5d78-0f3d-4c23-a530-c2289ce458fb', 'c3391378-0b89-475b-b065-49ab1ad0b991', 'e943c85b-5efa-4d37-a495-e3dde1c3d863', 'f2423b12-ddfc-4b53-a1ed-3577e2932f97']",A distributed parallel approach for BGP routing table partitioning in next generation routers,local computer networks,2010,4ad1c434-a72f-488c-aec7-a74ca9fcb425

"This paper proposes a new method for decoding multicarrier symbols with severe nonlinear distortion. The first part evaluates mutual information expressions for practical nonlinear models and shows the performance bounds for commonly used receiver structures. Then, we derive the maximum-likelihood (ML) sequence estimator, which unfortunately has an exponential complexity due to the nonlinear distortion. This extremely large complexity can be reduced with a simple algorithm that iteratively estimates the nonlinear distortion, thereby reducing the exponential ML to the standard ML without nonlinear distortion. The proposed method can be used to reduce the peak-to-average power ratio of multicarrier signals by clipping the transmit sequence. It can also be used to correct any nonlinear distortion present in transmitter/receiver amplifiers that are operating close to saturation.","['Jose Tellado', 'Louise M C Hoo', 'John M.

"In this paper, a robust adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control scheme is presented for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems preceded by an unknown dead-zone. Dead-zone characteristics are quite commonly encountered in actuators, such as hydraulic and pneumatic valves, electric servomotors, and electronic circuits, etc. Therefore, by using a description of a dead-zone and exploring the properties of this dead-zone model intuitively and mathematically, a robust adaptive fuzzy sliding control method is presented without constructing the dead-zone inverse. The unknown nonlinear functions of the plant are approximated by the fuzzy logic system according to some adaptive laws. Based on Lyapunov stability theorem and the theory of variable structure control, the proposed robust adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control scheme can guarantee the robust stability of the whole closed-loop system with an unknown dead-zone in the actuator and obtain good tracking performance as well.

"Most of the existing tracer kinetic models for dynamic contrast-enhanced CT or MRI do not fully describe the principles of intra- and transcapillary transport of tracers. One point is to disregard the concentration profiles between the inlets and outlets of capillaries, which may cause a biased estimation of tissue parameters by a systematic error. The Morales-Smith hypothesis enables one to resolve this ambiguity by assuming that the difference between arterial and venous concentrations is proportional to the difference between the arterial and capillary concentrations. If the backflow of administered tracer into the plasma compartment is negligible compared to its outflow into the interstitial compartment during the initial enhancement phase after tracer administration, the capillary concentration can be considered to fall exponentially along the capillary from the arterial concentration to the venous concentration by the Renkin-Crone model, i.e., unidirectional extraction fraction, which can be incorporated in the concept of the Morales-Smith hypothesis. In this study, we reformed the mass-balance equations and mathematical solutions of several representative and well-known tracer kinetic models so that the Morales-Smith hypothesis could be incorporated into their compartment tracer kinetics, considering a tissue-specific factor independent of time as proposed by Brix et al. [5]. The tissue-specific factor was applied to a liver tumor case study in perfusion CT to illustrate the potential effectiveness of the Morales-Smith hypothesis. The proposed scheme was shown to be potentially useful for more consistent and reliable estimation of physiologic tissue parameters.","['Sang Ho Lee', 'Wenli Cai', 'Hiroyuki Yoshida']",50,[],Tracer kinetic modeling by morales-smith hypothesis in hepatic perfusion CT,Abdominal Imaging,2012,4ad24813-c42d-4807-8bae-f8aca28d259c

"An analytic signal permits unambiguous characterization of the phase and envelope of a real signal. But the analytic signal's phase-derivative, i.e. the instantaneous frequency (IF) is typically a wild function and can take on values ranging from negative infinity to positive infinity. Fortunately, any analytic signal can be decomposed into a minimum phase (MinP) signal component and an all-phase (AllP) signal component. While the MinP signal's log-envelope and its phase form a Hilbert transform pair, the AllP signal has a positive definite instantaneous frequency (PIF) unlike that of the original analytic signal. We propose an elegant computational algorithm that separates the MinP and AllP components of the analytic signal. The envelope of the MinP component corresponds to the AM and the PIF of the AllP component corresponds to the positive FM.","['Ramdas Kumaresan', 'Ashwin Rao']",4,['b58189f7-08ed-482f-a7ac-8bd590f17350'],Algorithm for decomposing an analytic signal into AM and positive FM components,international conference on acoustics speech and signal processing,1998,4ad2789b-9a74-47b4-bd2d-0cc52196e4fb
"Complex event processing (CEP) has become increasingly important for tracking and monitoring applications ranging from health care, supply chain management to surveillance. These monitoring applications submit complex event queries to track sequences of events that match a given pattern. As these systems mature the need for increasingly complex nested sequence queries arises, while the state-of-the-art CEP systems mostly focus on the execution of flat sequence queries only. In this paper, we now introduce an iterative execution strategy for nested CEP queries composed of sequence, negation, AND and OR operators. Lastly we have introduced the promising direction of applying selective caching of intermediate results to optimize the execution.

"The complexity of real world image categorization and scene analysis requires compositional strategies for object representation. This contribution establishes a compositional hierarchy by first performing a perceptual bottom-up grouping of edge pixels to generate salient contour curves. A subsequent recursive top-down grouping yields a hierarchy of compositions. All entities in the compositional hierarchy are incorporated in a Bayesian network that couples them together by means of a shape model. The probabilistic model underlying top-down grouping as well as the shape model is learned automatically from a set of training images for the given categories. As a consequence, compositionality simplifies the learning of complex category models by building them from simple, frequently used compositions.

"Microprocessor trends are moving towards wider architectures and more aggressive speculation. With the increasing transistor budgets, energy consumption has become a critical design constraint. To address this problem, several researchers have proposed and evaluated energy-efficient variants of speculation mechanisms. However, such hardware is typically evaluated in isolation and its impact on the energy consumption of the rest of the processor, for example, due to wrong-path executions, is ignored. Moreover, the available metrics that would provide a thorough evaluation of an architectural optimization employ somewhat complicated formulas with hard-to-measure parametersIn this paper, we introduce a simple method to accurately compare the energy-efficiency of speculative architectures. Our metric is based on runtime analysis of the entire processor chip and thus captures the energy consumption due to the positive as well as the negative activities that arise from the speculation activities.

"Several strategies, known as clutter or wall Doppler filtering, were proposed to remove the strong echoes produced by stationary or slow moving tissue structures from the Doppler blood flow signal. In this study, the matching pursuit (MP) method is proposed to remove clutter components. The MP method decomposes the Doppler signal into wavelet atoms that are selected in a decreasing energy order. Thus, the high-energy clutter components are extracted first. In the present study, the pulsatile Doppler signal s(n) was simulated by a sum of random-phase sinusoids. Two types of high-amplitude clutter signals were then superimposed on s(n): time-varying low-frequency components, covering systole and early diastole, and short transient clutter signals, distributed within the whole cardiac cycle. The Doppler signals were modeled with the MP method and the most dominant atoms were subtracted from the time-domain signal s(n) until the signal-to-clutter (S/C) ratio reached a maximum. For the low-frequency clutter signal, the improvement in S/C ratio was 19.0 /spl plusmn/ 0.6 dB, and 72.0 /spl plusmn/ 4.5 atoms were required to reach this performance. For the transient clutter signal, ten atoms were required and the maximum improvement in S/C ratio was 5.5 /spl plusmn/ 0.5 dB. The performance of the MP method was also tested on real data recorded over the common carotid artery of a normal subject. Removing 15 atoms significantly improved the appearance of the Doppler sonogram contaminated with low-frequency clutter. Many more atoms (over 200) were required to remove transient clutter components. These results suggest the possibility of using this signal processing approach to implement clutter rejection filters on ultrasound commercial instruments.","['Guy Cloutier', 'Danmin Chen', 'Louis-Gilles Durand']",40,"['99c1f51c-71ab-4007-a0aa-1f8f834ab2fc', 'bb3c38fa-c2b0-4d4f-8c9d-ca1884343474']",A new clutter rejection algorithm for Doppler ultrasound,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,2003,4ad2c7b1-871a-4c9a-95e8-b0201c362a6d

The nature of the fMRI signal is reviewed with emphasis on the involved neuronal, physiological and physical processes and their modeling as dynamical systems.

"we present a medium access control (MAC) protocol for ad hoc networks with multiple input multiple output (MIMO) links. MIMO links provide extremely high spectral efficiencies in multipath channels by simultaneously transmitting multiple independent data streams in the same channel. MAC protocols have been proposed in related work for ad hoc networks with other classes of smart antennas such as switched beam antennas. However, as we substantiate in the paper, the unique characteristics of MIMO links coupled with several key optimization considerations, necessitate an entirely new MAC protocol. We identify several advantages of MIMO links, and discuss key optimization considerations that can help in realizing an effective MAC protocol for such an environment. We present a centralized algorithm called stream-controlled medium access (SCMA) that has the key optimization considerations incorporated in its design. Finally, we present a distributed SCMA protocol that approximates the centralized algorithm and compare its performance against that of baseline protocols that are CSMA/CA variants.","['Karthikeyan Sundaresan', 'Raghupathy Sivakumar', 'Mary Ann Ingram', 'Tae-Young Chang']",228,"['08dfd689-8a5b-453b-a5f6-a6b79a8be8c6', '10f58ff9-c14e-4bf5-9c44-0a3f14626d3f', '164a7293-cfe6-4167-ab36-a21ca408c1c5', '2826be57-107e-4ed1-ba88-01f0f1015668', '2e79dfe4-1842-4ff9-8ef9-31f82a5239b6', '32591c3e-f867-4910-91ec-ce8d8113767a', '70900ce7-fd5e-4779-a73d-8bdc42cfb3ff', '720f59d2-acc3-4d5a-91c2-258d137d9647', '786aaee0-9f07-40db-8178-6b47ec53553e', '8cc9ea80-563f-4e62-bda9-8ff6d71cf6ae', 'ccabb476-c38d-4867-bf93-60f1abe6e95b', 'd158cc4a-309b-4425-82b1-4f7f336c5c42', 'd9dbc407-897e-43dd-9999-5e351514bac0', 'eda6295a-5fd9-4e9b-af93-69c8726bf886', 'f180594d-7f0a-472d-96ac-e9f379380870', 'fb2003f6-ed7b-424e-94b2-6b150f8e7302']",Medium access control in ad hoc networks with MIMO links: optimization considerations and algorithms,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2004,4ad2cd00-4194-4c5e-92dc-606fd58d8fe1
"Due to the enormous spreading of applied wireless networks, security is actually one of the most important issues for telecommunications. One of the main issue in the field of securing wireless information exchanging is the initial common knowledge between source and destination. A shared secret is normally mandatory in order to decide the encryption (algorithm or code or key) of the information stream. It is usual to exchange this common a priori knowledge by using a ""secure"" channel. Now a days a secure wireless channel is not possible. In fact normally the common a priori knowledge is already established (but this is not secure) or by using a non-radio channel (that implies a waste of time and resource). This contribution deals with the proposal of a new modulation technique ensuring secure communication in a full wireless environment. The information is modulated, at physical layer, by the thermal noise experienced by the link between two terminals. A loop scheme is designed for unique recovering of mutual information. The probability of error/detection is analytically derived for the legal users and for the third unwanted listener. The proposed scheme has also been implemented in a Xilinx Virtex II FPGA.#R##N##R##N#All the results show that the performance of the proposed scheme yields the advantage of intrinsic security, i.e., the mutual information cannot be physically demodulated (passive attack) or denied (active attack) by a third terminal, leading us to conclude that the proposed technique is really useful for private key distribution in every wireless network.","['Lorenzo Mucchi', 'Luca Simone Ronga', 'E.

"Undersea warfare relies heavily on acoustic means to detect a submerged vessel. The frequency of the acoustic signal radiated by the vessel is typically very low, thus requires a large array aperture to achieve acceptable angular resolution. In this paper, we present a novel approach for low-frequency direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation using miniature circular vector-sensor array mounted on the perimeter of a cylinder. Under this approach, we conduct beamforming using decomposition in the acoustic mode domain rather than frequency domain, to avoid the long wavelength constraints. We first introduce a multi-layer acoustic gradient scattering model to provide a guideline and performance predication tool for the mode beamformer design and algorithm. We optimize the array gain and frequency response with this model. We further develop the adaptive DOA estimation algorithm based on this model. We formulate the Capon spectra of the mode beamformer which is independent of the frequency band after the mode decomposition. Numerical simulations are conducted to quantify the performance and evaluate the theoretical results developed in this study.","['Nan Zou', 'Arye Nehorai']",43,['979f744f-c4f5-4ed1-9030-b7975b49004f'],Circular Acoustic Vector-Sensor Array for Mode Beamforming,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing,2009,4ad2e001-39fc-4327-a2d6-a12ed8b0c10e

"In this paper, we propose a fast algorithm for principal component analysis (PCA) dealing with large high-dimensional data sets. A large data set is firstly divided into several small data sets. Then, the traditional PCA method is applied on each small data set and several eigenspace models are obtained, where each eigenspace model is computed from a small data set. At last, these eigenspace models are merged into one eigenspace model which contains the PCA result of the original data set. Experiments on the FERET data set show that this algorithm is much faster than the traditional PCA method, while the principal components and the reconstruction errors are almost the same as that given by the traditional method.","['Liang Liu', 'Yunhong Wang', 'Qian Wang', 'Tieniu Tan']",50,"['48be5984-89df-484f-8c4c-a610e98b9e87', '79091b41-1e28-435a-ab88-d9d6143f56df', 'ef2656ac-3917-4410-9da4-1da6953f0563', 'f7575c9a-3a18-43b9-8b44-554c7d177af0']",Fast Principal Component Analysis using Eigenspace Merging,international conference on image processing,2007,4ad2fec3-fd25-4673-adce-031526123649
"As the High Performance Computing industry moves towards the exascale era of computing, parallel scientific and engineering applications are becoming increasingly complex. The use of simulation allows us to predict how an application's performance will change with the adoption of new hardware or software, helping to inform procurement decisions. In this paper, we present a disk simulator designed to predict the performance of read and write operations to a single hard disk drive (HDD). Our simulator uses a geometry discovery benchmark (Diskovery) in order to estimate the data layout of the HDD, as well as the time spent moving the read/write head. We validate our simulator against two different HDDs, using a benchmark designed to simulate common disk read and write patterns, demonstrating accuracy to within 5% of the observed I/O time for sequential operations, and to within 10% of the observed time for seek-heavy workloads.","['Steven A.

"JPEG2000 is a new international standard for still image compression. It provides various functions in one single coding stream and the better compression quality than the traditional JPEG, especially in the high compression ratio. However, the heavy computation and large internal memory requirement still restrict the consumer electronics applications. In this paper, we propose a QCB (quad code block)-based DWT method to achieve the higher parallelism than the traditional DWT approach of JPEG2000 coding process. Based on the QCB-based DWT engine, three code blocks can be completely generated after every fixed time slice recursively. Thus, the DWT and EBCOT processors can process simultaneously and the high computational EBCOT then has the higher parallelism of the JPEG2000 encoding system. By changing the output timing of the DWT process and parallelizing with EBCOT, the internal tile memory size can be reduced by a factor of 4. The memory access cycles between the internal tile memory and the code block memory also decrease with the smooth encoding flow.","['Bing-Fei Wu', 'Chung-Fu Lin']",50,"['01685c08-98ef-445b-ad28-3d3f879e8de0', '12d7ef3b-e9fd-44c3-b997-3ab93057ff52', '176cd61b-0e18-4829-9fee-aae709de290a', '1bfd7038-5ce6-4ef5-afed-4d047bc2ac80', '2cb5da59-9fb5-48be-a540-01ce19c883bd', '341880c4-4239-45b0-9ba8-6d173bac1f24', '37708b6d-80cd-4d60-bc32-9255c830032a', '3c6e6000-5abb-4b8b-a807-fff2821f2012', '4e726ea7-ac6c-48d3-92c8-34f649160a94', '54c02492-a327-4b48-8f1f-4b5b84315704', '55059c66-b1f8-4ec3-83cc-d86e0ce3d937', '5976a700-7757-4fd1-8c67-e40967b442db', '5be16126-0bbc-401a-81ea-aabe5da46ad9', '6888b12c-2a23-4f29-b268-cd2ea9264fed', '883e4392-5a4b-4cc5-bd6f-ac607f048c83', '923dabe3-d97e-4e5c-bead-b52dccb0d455', 'b439c305-4aa5-4e0b-badd-18891f0ddbf0', 'b7e01b83-e270-40cd-91b0-9a4e02dde612', 'c8c55475-2750-431a-9ee4-fa3540258c6f', 'cd09ef4f-edd4-4134-8b93-9535d190e329', 'e1a6e9b1-72c0-490b-add8-1b4a0480ebf3', 'e947bd0f-55db-4188-92b1-7de45056468f', 'eeb48485-3636-4b5a-9a77-b8cef76633b2']",An efficient architecture for JPEG2000 coprocessor,IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics,2004,4ad3a94c-5312-40c4-bcf5-8791287832c1

Yet, popular exemplars’ effects extend well beyond that of other talking sources.

"We derive the maximum mutual information for an additive exponential noise (AEN) channel with a peak input constraint. We find that the optimizing input density is mixed (with singularities) similar to previous results for AEN channels with a mean input constraint. Likewise, the maximum mutual information takes a similar form, though obviously the maximum for the peak constraint is smaller than for the corresponding mean-constrained channel. This model is inspired by multiple biological phenomena and processes which can be abstracted as follows: inscribed matter is sent by an emitter, moves through a medium, and arrives eventually at its destination receptor. The inscribed matter can convey information in a variety of ways such as the number of signaling quanta - molecules, macromolecular complexes, organelles, cells and tissues - that are emitted as well as the detailed pattern of their release. However, rather than focus on a general class of emitter-receptor systems or a particular exemplar of biomedical importance, our ultimate goal is to provide bounds on the potential efficacy of timed-release signaling for any system which emits identical signaling quanta. That is, we seek to apply one of the most potent aspects of information theory to biological signaling - mechanism blindness - in the hopes of gaining insights applicable to diverse systems that span a wide range of spatiotemporal scales.","['Yl Tsai', 'Christopher Rose', 'Ruochen Song', 'I.

"This work provides an exhaustive search algorithm for finding small fully absorbing sets (FASs) of arbitrary low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. In particular, given any LDPC code, the problem of finding all FASs of size less than t is formulated as an integer programming problem, for which a new branch-&-bound algorithm is devised. New node selection and the tree-trimming mechanisms are designed to further enhance the efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed algorithm is capable of finding all FASs of size ≤ 11 with no larger than 2 induced odd-degree check nodes for LDPC codes of length ≤ 1000. The resulting exhaustive list of small FASs is then used to devise a new post-processing decoder. Numerical results show that by taking advantage of the exhaustive list of small FASs, the proposed decoder significantly lowers the error floor for codes of practical lengths and outperforms the state-of-the-art low-error-floor decoders.","['Gyu Bum Kyung', 'Chih-Chun Wang']",50,"['01cb1b96-89ea-41a1-8a44-a876b7bf9cb1', '2382b6ec-c5f7-4655-9b17-9ba1b193ba03', '32e684e6-bc85-4118-adeb-d66ad3b71fa1', '7bd0fbc8-ec95-4581-94c5-0cbee4ef0f97', '7d453434-e999-4763-a5f8-c07028fa544a', '821be1db-e869-4a1e-a0cc-726270b44dde', '9d9e836c-53df-4445-87da-a4b51a455629', 'bbd7478d-6920-422b-ba90-16d83e744a67', 'bdd64d49-6769-4736-bdad-f9d6b151def6', 'bfc24cd3-1bac-4e5a-94ac-d552a7d36929', 'cbce2caa-2d24-4c1d-bb08-9437308ce5bc', 'd0f2dc64-acd5-471f-8e7d-9dadff7e18e3', 'd8655a74-80cc-4554-95fd-cad0d74f8c9b', 'fba7f906-a615-40bf-b314-3f0d943d1a99']",Exhaustive search for small fully absorbing sets and the corresponding low error-floor decoder,international symposium on information theory,2010,4ad41b00-afce-4b0c-b42d-cefd1abc73d2

"The popular IEEE 802.11 wireless local area network (WLAN) is based on a carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), where a station listens to the medium before transmission in order to avoid collision. If there exist stations which can not hear each other, i.e., hidden stations, the potential collision probability increases, thus dramatically degrading the network throughput. The RTS/CTS (request-to-send/clear-to-send) frame exchange is a solution for the hidden station problem, but the RTS/CTS exchange itself consumes the network resources by transmitting the control frames. In order to maximize the network throughput, we need to use the RTS/CTS exchange adaptively only when hidden stations exist in the network. In this letter, a simple but very effective hidden station detection mechanism is proposed. Once a station detects the hidden stations via the proposed detection mechanism, it can trigger the usage of the RTS/CTS exchange. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism can provide the maximum system throughput performance","['Youngsoo Kim', 'Jeonggyun Yu', 'Sunghyun Choi', 'Kyunghun Jang']",50,['14b569bb-cf5d-4f06-9bbe-a2f97a6c42cb'],A novel hidden station detection mechanism in IEEE 802.11 WLAN,IEEE Communications Letters,2006,4ad4467f-618c-4936-96fb-dfe2e4b1fe34

Additionally, in order to improve perceptual quality of interpolated frame, spatial smoothness criterion is employed.

"We propose and analyze several strategies for performing timestamping of an MPEG-2 Transport Stream transmitted over a packet-switched network using the PCR-unaware encapsulation scheme, and analyze their effect on the quality of the recovered clock at the MPEG-2 Systems decoder. When the timestamping scheme is based on a timer with a fixed period, the PCR values in the packet stream may switch polarity deterministically, at a frequency determined by the timer period and the transport rate of the MPEG signal. This, in turn, can degrade the duality of the recovered clock at the receiver beyond acceptable limits. We consider three timestamping schemes for solving this problem: (1) selecting a deterministic timer period to avoid the phase difference in PCR values altogether, (2) fine-tuning the deterministic timer period to maximize the frequency of PCR polarity changes, and (3) selecting the timer period randomly to eliminate the deterministic PCR polarity changes. For the case of deterministic timer period, we derive the frequency of the PCR polarity changes as a function of the timer period and the transport rate, and use it to find ranges of the timer period for acceptable quality of the recovered clock. We also analyze a random timestamping procedure based on a random telegraph process and obtain lower bounds on the rate of PCR polarity changes such that the recovered clock does not violate the PAL/NTSC clock specifications. The analytical results are verified by simulations with both synthetic and actual MPEG-2 Transport Streams sent to a simulation model of an MPEG-2 Systems decoder.","['Christos Tryfonas', 'Anujan Varma']",50,['ee754a79-7244-41b6-97d5-99c397ce384b'],Timestamping schemes for MPEG-2 systems layer and their effect on receiver clock recovery,IEEE Transactions on Multimedia,1999,4ad47478-a69e-4a1c-ba45-97fbcbab78b4

"Adaptive modeling of digital hearing aids is useful in characterizing the hearing aid behavior in response to “real world” stimuli such as speech and music. Most modern hearing aids employ amplitude compression in different frequency bands for effective mapping of the wide dynamic range audio signals into the reduced dynamic range of the hearing impaired listeners. Due to the presence of independent compression channels, the conventional fullband adaptive model might not adequately characterize the performance of a multichannel compression hearing aid (MCHA). In this paper, we propose a subband adaptive modeling approach to characterize the electroacoustic performance of a MCHA. The proposed structure employs uniform, oversampled DFT filterbanks for analysis and synthesis, and the affine projection algorithm for adaptive modeling in each subband. Experiments with simulated MCHAs showed that the subband structure outperforms the fullband structure under a variety of operating conditions.","['Vijay Parsa', 'Donald G.

"As the number of applications and programmable units in CMPs and MPSoCs increases, the Network-on-Chip (NoC) encounters unpredictable, heterogeneous and time dependent traffic loads. This motivates the introduction of adaptive routing mechanisms that balance the NoC's loads and achieve higher throughput compared with traditional oblivious routing schemes. An effective adaptive routing scheme should be based on a global view of the network state. However, most current adaptive routing schemes, following off-chip networks, are based on distributed reactions to local congestion. In this paper we leverage the unique on-chip capabilities and introduce a novel paradigm of NoC centralized adaptive routing. Our scheme continuously monitors the global traffic load in the network and modifies the routing of packets to improve load balancing accordingly. We present a specific design for the case of mesh topology, where XY or YX routes are adaptively selected for each source-destination pair. We show that while our implementation is lightweight and scalable in hardware costs, it outperforms oblivious and distributed adaptive routing schemes in terms of load balancing and average packet delay.","['Ran Manevich', 'Israel Cidon', 'Avinoam Kolodny', ""Isask'har Walter"", 'Shmuel Wimer']",31,"['30162fb9-f9f3-4626-b77e-8b65f44a3d48', '35f976be-6673-4f7e-8196-e18f65f231cd', '3b8f8088-8422-4d89-b825-4f31c7514acb', '3d9e52bb-b80b-4647-ae2a-69bee3491f23', '51a22863-6058-45e6-a8dc-5703d30cc8c4', '5394d502-c504-45ab-b691-307206182f20', '5657a767-0a43-4536-9614-79dbf4c6fd58', '645b5a96-fc45-4d27-9183-59f6e53a2734', '6c748c16-9755-4289-9b45-1081e0a38756', '7046b2ff-4972-4254-9990-9c41983b9d83', '73739568-56c1-4153-a32c-3961d4edb81f', '913f2a80-5600-41a7-b739-bdaad8b186f2', '914c6d00-5cd1-437c-a7f7-a0def4f66485', '9b50dc83-e0a0-46e7-ab1f-aabe3fd5348e', '9e79f0ff-ac11-47fb-a413-6a1fa62f7691', 'a4f95e3a-17b0-46ed-a588-341d2bc53a33', 'b9729ce1-6d50-4075-8404-2cf8786cb9a2', 'bc971746-8b11-4be9-8de3-dda29854d559', 'd1b5884f-ce7e-4c64-8b2d-d60138a78195', 'dccc88cb-e6f3-4784-a1c0-a355300bab88', 'e03f2e50-171a-4343-910e-cc145f6f6a3a', 'e5c8d0e6-6e66-4aa9-92c0-af1738957099', 'f7e7ca9d-467f-448e-aa99-2dfd4935a8ed']",A Cost Effective Centralized Adaptive Routing for Networks-on-Chip,digital systems design,2011,4ad53206-4f4d-487b-b758-555bbd1e3c3a
"This paper presents a contribution to Word Spotting applied for digitized Syriac manuscripts. The Syriac language was wrongfully accused of being a dead language and has been set aside by the domain of handwriting recognition. Yet it is a very fascinating handwriting that combines the word structure and calligraphy of the Arabic handwriting with the particularity of being intentionally written tilted by an angle of approximately 45deg. For the spotting process, we developed a method that should find all occurrences of a certain query word image, based on a selective sliding window technique, from which we extract directional features and afterwards perform a matching using Euclidean distance correspondence between features. The proposed method does not require any prior information, and does not depend of a word to character segmentation algorithm which would be extremely complex to realize due to the tilted nature of the handwriting.","['Petra Bilane', 'Stéphane Bres', 'Hubert Emptoz']",50,"['03073956-29e1-4785-88ed-af4cc41503f3', '0fd421fb-1cbc-4324-b26c-50acdd336342', '1b01a0b5-9fdf-4503-b021-6ef35f8b1a32', '256869d2-6a7f-43c9-b826-f41821e1bd9f', '51c5ac35-dce5-4bf6-bf83-862f7dda8f33', '54dfd530-de79-4fe4-9417-fe44ce1ff1a5', '61b503ed-d8c9-4e5d-ba86-9209be638e82', '69e30566-1f46-4db4-aadf-dad56f7f38ab', '6b91e7b0-a0d2-406f-8065-389a1da0a129', '89f8b36b-0678-4fec-8532-ad927b8da7e2', 'b85260ac-0b60-44c3-8f35-9a25957da494', 'c494c7dc-c30a-4eed-b54a-35de5fa45202', 'cc83c96c-4ff6-4ba1-b36f-82639047216f', 'd16ce6dd-a639-4d72-b9d3-98c3b2c2c64a', 'e08930e5-ec02-44c1-9a72-c37ff7faca6d', 'f489c21a-10ef-41e0-adc5-a9000ee8dda4']",Robust directional features for wordspotting in degraded Syriac manuscripts,content based multimedia indexing,2008,4ad55681-9197-41a7-b64c-859927312fb7
Document clustering algorithms usually use vector space model (VSM) as their underlying model for document representation. VSM assumes that terms are independent and accordingly ignores any semantic relations between them. This results in mapping documents to a space where the proximity between document vectors does not reflect their true semantic similarity. This paper proposes new models for document representation that capture semantic similarity between documents based on measures of correlations between their terms. The paper uses the proposed models to enhance the effectiveness of different algorithms for document clustering. The proposed representation models define a corpus-specific semantic similarity by estimating measures of term–term correlations from the documents to be clustered. The corpus of documents accordingly defines a context in which semantic similarity is calculated. Experiments have been conducted on thirteen benchmark data sets to empirically evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed models and compare them to VSM and other well-known models for capturing semantic similarity.,"['Ahmed K.

"This paper presents a new method for injecting human inputs into mixed-initiative interactions between humans and robots. The method is based on a model-predictive control (MPC) formulation, which inevitably involves predicting the system (robot dynamics as well as human input) into the future. These predictions are complicated by the fact that the human is interacting with the robot, causing the prediction method itself to have an effect on future human inputs. We investigate and develop different prediction schemes, including fixed and variable horizon MPCs and human input estimators of different orders. Through a search-and-rescue-inspired human operator study, we arrive at the conclusion that the simplest prediction methods outperform the more complex ones, i.e., in this particular case, less is indeed more.","['Rahul Chipalkatty', 'Greg Droge', 'Magnus Egerstedt']",25,"['05dc7361-18e9-42d3-8948-f49f7017a3ef', '07f84182-b3c5-43ff-ab01-e6ad5e8783d9', '09c80e8e-0cc9-4ef9-bb4d-dcd097f49a4a', '17db50a1-846e-443c-bb55-661a2ea86d7c', '1cae20d3-66d8-46d0-a270-da2a988f8b4a', '1dfddb0a-c28f-4852-af75-d6c8f3c971a4', '27952bf0-bd04-4fa8-88e5-738d78ecd5be', '2bc4a62f-de47-438a-a9f6-5b83ae2c9ac0', '343943c0-541b-47d4-8bfe-73e946ccce39', '4aa1e93d-9fb1-467e-b0bd-4a96fd5ba64c', '551d6093-3ec6-4317-af3b-bb0f5c744c71', '60f6cf9f-6de4-4873-98fc-4b487627a6a0', '692f6638-efa1-4bea-a64a-a4649b9d9722', '71283638-c862-483f-b8d1-ab6f00ea8fa8', '911b9e74-510e-43ee-8ac2-510b073d8a1e', '945dc262-7033-40da-8fee-7e5939ff7d57', '95c475ba-7092-4a67-8de1-e5867cd0bcce', 'a9514d35-30ef-4acf-900f-e8a0da358f54', 'bed48622-d69f-4787-8392-3f24578e66ab', 'd3d8b691-c2a9-4822-a507-65850d3bddaf', 'fb4e9595-9566-4e16-8def-087ac7ef7416']",Less Is More: Mixed-Initiative Model-Predictive Control With Human Inputs,IEEE Transactions on Robotics,2013,4ad58116-8003-4dfb-8d4c-ec86e5669c69
"There are few localization schemes targeted at mobile wireless sensor networks. This paper proposed an enhanced color-theory-based dynamic localization (E-CDL) which is based on the CDL algorithm (Shee, 2005). However, the location accuracy of this algorithm depends on the accuracy of the average hop distance derivation. Therefore, the authors present two novel schemes to estimate the average hop distance. The authors analyzed the behavior of sensor nodes communication, and computed the expected value of the average hop distance, which is 7r/9 where r is the radio range. In addition, since CDL is based on the DV-hop scheme, the derived shortest path length is usually larger than the corresponding Euclidean distance. With this observation, the derived shortest path length can be adjusted by the ratio of the Euclidean distance and the shortest path distance to further enhance the location accuracy. Finally, in mobile wireless sensor networks, sensor nodes may become isolated. By employing mobile anchor nodes, the isolation problem can be relieved and hence the location accuracy can be improved. Simulation results have shown that the location accuracy of E-CDL is 50%-55% better than that of CDL, and 75%-80% better than that of MCL (Monte Carlo localization) (Lingxuan and David, 2004), In addition, the authors have implemented and verified our algorithm on the MICAz Mote developer's kit.","['Tzu-Chien Chang', 'Kuochen Wang', 'Yi-Ling Hsieh']",11,"['105314df-68a1-40e0-b793-af225567b50c', '1eadf267-28ed-4e6f-a5e9-6adf2b179b89', '32b7988a-f873-44c9-bacb-0d660fe12f01', '3939cb96-d8c8-4ec4-8102-bbce2976aeee', '3b78ff56-43dd-40af-9e78-5de448ce9caa', '42839cf3-cb99-408d-932a-7cc912f5fb23', '4b1e5895-3cc7-4e55-b6fd-df042e34acc4', '4f5530bf-de86-4f1d-a55f-24202a7aa691', '6820b9d6-39ef-4689-8bf4-70b085052998', '76af63ce-91b3-4f77-8534-50135bdae74f', 'ac70dec0-750f-4b9c-a7fb-c556878f5ded', 'b52ed313-d3f6-4ee0-9ff0-ce7193d493a7', 'e3534086-a103-4071-8821-cd864ffa4e1f', 'f4da9c3e-7e0b-45ff-b304-3df1859472fd', 'f7369f7a-9b95-41c3-9b03-e422a81a37ce', 'f8a9df79-9be7-4333-a71c-327040f67fcd']",Enhanced Color-Theory-Based Dynamic Localization in Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks,wireless communications and networking conference,2007,4ad5a0ef-eb44-4523-b483-f232aeae4a08

"Off-line robot dynamic identification methods are mostly based on the use of the inverse dynamic model, which is linear with respect to the dynamic parameters. This model is calculated with torque and position sampled data while the robot is tracking reference trajectories that excite the system dynamics. This allows using linear least-squares techniques to estimate the parameters. This method requires the joint force/torque and position measurements and the estimate of the joint velocity and acceleration, through the bandpass filtering of the joint position at high sampling rates. A new method called DIDIM (Direct and Inverse Dynamic Identification Models) has been proposed and validated on a 2 degree-of-freedom robot [1]. DIDIM method requires only the joint force/torque measurement. It is based on a closed-loop simulation of the robot using the direct dynamic model, the same structure of the control law, and the same reference trajectory for both the actual and the simulated robot. The optimal parameters minimize the 2-norm of the error between the actual force/torque and the simulated force/torque. A validation experiment on a 6 dof Staubli TX40 robot shows that DIDIM method is very efficient on industrial robots.","['Maxime Gautier', 'Pierre-Olivier Vandanjon', 'Alexandre Janot']",19,"['180e4a69-9ffe-498c-98d1-1f950958412f', '5ff77a6b-2ee4-4c30-9a14-a41c4b4bde43', '61e151d0-2ecd-4991-9e53-58db72e06302', 'bbf36381-8bb6-472b-8235-b4add09c2873', 'd192d3de-af49-42f1-8323-95deab42f614', 'f231d4c7-40ec-45e6-8786-8bbbdb5529b0', 'f508fb91-c54a-4be1-8288-018a8e286ad5']",Dynamic identification of a 6 dof robot without joint position data,international conference on robotics and automation,2011,4ad5cc51-eadf-4ed8-8d26-f52943baf515
"It has been commonly recognized that multiple bit-rate (MBR) encoding provides a concise method for video streaming over bandwidth-fluctuant networks. The key problem of the MBR technique lies in how to seamlessly switch one bit-stream to another one. To tackle this problem, we propose a bit-stream switching framework based on the Wyner-Ziv coding. Within the propose framework, the multiple bit-streams can be individually encoded without data exchange, which also supports the random switching at any desired frame without affecting the original coding efficiency of the regular bit-stream. In particular, two different implementation schemes under the same framework are presented. Different from the traditional switching schemes, the proposed method can use the same switching frame for the switching from any other bit-stream to the current one, which means less storage and less encoding efforts. Simulation results and comparison between the proposed method and the traditional switching method in H.264 are also presented.","['Wen Sun', 'Yan Lu', 'Feng Wu']",50,"['4aa6d2f8-2633-4e06-849f-f81badaac3d6', '8ad6b097-12be-4562-9b2c-3bcbffb9cb97', 'ae08785c-33b3-426c-bb5e-61fe5143f00a', 'f1b53f72-b185-4e4e-9b75-ebc637857809']",Bit-Stream Switching in Multiple Bit-Rate Video Streaming using Wyner-Ziv Coding,international conference on multimedia and expo,2006,4ad5d749-1b92-462d-aa87-264105cb048a
"We describe and evaluate a framework, the Medical Database Adaptor (MEIDA), for linking knowledge-based medical decision-support systems (MDSSs) to multiple clinical databases, using standard medical schemata and vocabularies. Our solution involves a set of tools for embedding standard terms and units within knowledge bases (KBs) of MDSSs; a set of methods and tools for mapping the local database (DB) schema and the terms and units relevant to the KB of the MDSS into standardized schema, terms and units, using three heuristics (choice of a vocabulary, choice of a key term, and choice of a measurement unit); and a set of tools which, at runtime, automatically map standard term queries originating from the KB, to queries formulated using the local DB's schema, terms and units. The methodology was successfully evaluated by mapping three KBs to three DBs. Using a unit-domain matching heuristic reduced the number of term-mapping candidates by a mean of 71% even after other heuristics were used. Runtime access of 10,000 records required one second. We conclude that mapping MDSSs to different local clinical DBs, using the three-phase methodology and several term-mapping heuristics, is both feasible and efficient.","['Efrat German', 'Akiva Leibowitz', 'Yuval Shahar']",49,"['0dc5f0af-ec26-4de6-b2e6-2440b4e6b854', '17ffa108-cb6e-4393-a380-6aaa9fb70302', '1da4e6b3-4dd0-4aee-a7a7-5601e70003b9', '7ed7a79e-b6a1-46cf-b1b7-847115fb6c82', 'ac84320b-60f9-4ec7-9e1f-cfbff65545bf', 'b0622ddf-9922-4f47-a87c-e27989b2e2d6', 'dd694d42-ec2c-40c8-a616-b817d9f01c1a', 'de01490e-29b1-435c-93bb-88952180c083', 'e2b95f6d-f152-4dd7-b318-987c56c99d08']",An architecture for linking medical decision-support applications to clinical databases and its evaluation,Journal of Biomedical Informatics,2009,4ad5ffb9-1b78-40eb-8f11-6eef22fc0c81

"A software RAID is a RAID implemented purely in software running on a host computer. One problem with software RAIDs is that they do not have access to special hardware such as NVRAM. Thus, software RAIDs may need to check every parity group of an array for consistency following a host crash or power failure. This process of checking parity groups is called recovery, and results in long delays when the software RAID is restarted. The authors review two algorithms to reduce this recovery time for software RAIDs: the PGS bitmap algorithm and the list algorithm. They compare the performance of these two algorithms using trace-driven simulations. Their results show that the PGS bitmap algorithm can reduce recovery time by a factor of 12 with a response time penalty of less than 1%, or by a factor of 50 with a response time penalty of less than 2%, and a memory requirement of around 9 Kbytes. The list algorithm can reduce recovery time by a factor of 50 but cannot achieve a response time penalty of less than 16%.","['Jeff Riegel', 'Jai Menon']",50,"['0b83e311-2dae-4e28-8d6b-f933adaa445c', '96ff09f7-e819-4de9-aaf8-9eac2f5fa751', 'ae6b3d68-b2a4-4536-a456-8dda6bf5e0d8']",Performance of recovery time improvement algorithms for software RAIDs,,1996,4ad64057-9b8e-4961-a6bd-9de9bc268828

"A network-on-chip (NoC) replaces on-chip communication implemented by point-to-point interconnects in a multi-core environment by a set of shared interconnects connected through programmable crosspoints. Since an NoC may provide a number of paths between a given source and destination, manufacturing or runtime faults on one interconnect does not necessarily render the chip useless. It is partly because of this fault tolerance that NoCs have emerged as a viable alternative for implementing communication between functional units of a chip in the nanometer regime, where high defect rates are prevalent. In this paper, the authors quantify the fault tolerance offered by an NoC against process variations. Specifically, the authors develop an analytical model for the probability of failure in buffered global NoC links due to interconnect dishing, and effective channel length variation.

"Many rely now on public cloud infrastructure-as-a-service for database servers, mainly, by pushing the limits of existing pooling and replication software to operate large shared-nothing virtual server clusters. Yet, it is unclear whether this is still the best architectural choice, namely, when cloud infrastructure provides seamless virtual shared storage and bills clients on actual disk usage.   This paper addresses this challenge with Resilient Asynchronous Commit (RAsC), an improvement to awell-known shared-nothing design based on the assumption that a much larger number of servers is required for scale than for resilience. Then we compare this proposal to other database server architectures using an analytical model focused on peak throughput and conclude that it provides the best performance/cost trade-off while at the same time addressing a wide range of fault scenarios.","['Lu ´ is Soares', 'José Pereira']",50,"['02701cf3-ac9a-42ef-ae23-a1c8e43bfc76', '02761022-cc25-4ea9-9eb6-3bfe2142d7da', '1612e6bc-9bde-4a14-a1da-694ed2f3bb16', '2049c7a0-ac6d-42e4-ba35-71b492a7315a', '27275e74-93d7-4267-bfd7-8d0a936a1f26', '3562f185-a039-4d79-8176-f2b15aa6abdb', '4a832f86-b2cd-4393-84b0-bd998cf885b1', '84b51058-b66b-4fb2-841b-55b9f5ccc281', '8a18ce56-3d85-4d17-9909-ce543728daff', '9f27d895-7efd-4726-94e3-5f57f8ff550f', 'ad652a41-b41c-40b1-8c8a-5b1ce08aec86', 'b2bb3757-9330-4756-bdd3-0141f286e2d8', 'b33d036d-9401-4000-a77e-60a0c4840557', 'c8ae3d9a-b925-4815-b9b3-174e49d7a9da', 'eaa340b0-5c17-4462-b64e-937249e40bfe', 'f267387c-e2d2-40bd-8e23-0cac668684f1']",Improving the scalability of cloud-based resilient database servers,distributed applications and interoperable systems,2011,4ad71b7d-55fc-43c8-8f7d-0be0476a9b54
"Lately, the interest in advanced video-based surveillance applications has been increasing. This is especially true in the field of urban railway transport where video-based surveillance can be exploited to face many relevant security aspects (e.g. vandalism, overcrowding, abandoned object detection etc.). This paper aims at investigating an open problem in the implementation of video-based surveillance systems for transport applications, i.e., the implementation of reliable image understanding modules in order to recognize dangerous situations with reduced false alarm and misdetection rates. We considered the use of a neural network-based classifier for detecting vandal behavior in metro stations. The achieved results show that the classifier achieves very good performance even in the presence of high scene complexity.","['Claudio Sacchi', 'Carlo S.

"Performing morphological operations such as dilation and erosion of binary images, using very long line structuring elements is computationally expensive when performed brute-force following definitions. We present two-pass algorithms that run at constant time for obtaining binary dilations and erosions with all possible length line structuring elements, simultaneously. The algorithms run at constant time for any orientation of the line structuring element. Another contribution of this paper is the use of the concept of orientation error between a continuous line and its discrete counterpart. The orientation error is used in determining the minimum length of the basic digital line structuring element used in obtaining what we call dilation and erosion transforms. The transforms are then thresholded by the length of the desired structuring element to obtain the dilation and erosion results. The algorithms require only one maximum operation for erosion transform and only one minimum operation for dilation transform, and one thresholding step and one translation step per result pixel. We tested the algorithms on Sun Sparc Station 10, on a set of 240/spl times/250 salt and pepper noise images with probability of a pixel being a 1-pixel set to 0.25, for orientations of the normals of the structuring elements in the range [/spl pi//2,3/spl pi//2] and lengths, in pixels, in the range [5,145]. We achieved a speed up of about 50 (and for special orientations /spl theta/ /spl isin/ {(/spl pi//2), (3/spl pi//4), /spl pi/, (5/spl pi//4), (3/spl pi//2)} a speed up of about 100) when the structuring elements had lengths of 145 pixels, over the brute-force methods in these experiments. We compared the results of our dilation algorithm with those of the algorithm discussed by Soille et al. (see IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Machine Intell., vol.18, p.562-67, 1996) and showed that for binary dilation (and erosion since it is just the dilation of the background with the reflected structuring element) our algorithm performed better and achieved a speed up of about four when dilation or erosion transform alone is obtained.","['Desikachari Nadadur', 'Robert M.

"Given a finite set of alternatives A, the sorting (or assignment) problem consists in the assignment of each alternative to one of the pre-defined categories. In this paper, we are interested in multiple criteria sorting problems and, more precisely, in the existing method ELECTRE TRI. This method requires the elicitation of preferential parameters (weights, thresholds, category limits,…) in order to construct a preference model which the decision maker (DM) accepts as a working hypothesis in the decision aid study. A direct elicitation of these parameters requiring a high cognitive effort from the DM (V. Mosseau, R. Slowinski, Journal of Global Optimization 12 (2) (1998) 174), proposed an interactive aggregation–disaggregation approach that infers ELECTRE TRI parameters indirectly from holistic information, i.e., assignment examples. In this approach, the determination of ELECTRE TRI parameters that best restore the assignment examples is formulated through a nonlinear optimization program.#R##N##R##N#In this paper, we consider the subproblem of the determination of the weights only (the thresholds and category limits being fixed). This subproblem leads to solve a linear program (rather than nonlinear in the global inference model). Numerical experiments were conducted so as to check the behaviour of this disaggregation tool. Results showed that this tool is able to infer weights that restores in a stable way the assignment examples and that it is able to identify “inconsistencies” in the assignment examples.","['Vincent Mousseau', 'José Rui Figueira', 'J.-Ph.

"Low voltage operation of digital circuits continues to be an attractive option for aggressive power reduction. As standard SRAM bitcells are limited to operation in the strong-inversion regimes due to process variations and local mismatch, the development of specially designed SRAMs for low voltage operation has become popular in recent years. In this paper, we present a novel 9T bitcell, implementing a Supply Feedback concept to internally weaken the pull-up current during write cycles and thus enable low-voltage write operations. As opposed to the majority of existing solutions, this is achieved without the need for additional peripheral circuits and techniques. The proposed bitcell is fully functional under global and local variations at voltages from 250 mV to 1.1 V. In addition, the proposed cell presents a low-leakage state reducing power up to 60%, as compared to an identically supplied 8T bitcell. An 8 kbit SF-SRAM array was implemented and fabricated in a low-power 40 nm process, showing full functionality and ultra-low power.","['Adam Teman', 'Lidor Pergament', 'Omer Cohen', 'Alexander Fish']",76,"['00c2bb61-14d1-4875-b669-fdedd5309f17', '2aa5cdaf-f7a3-49a5-9eb5-d7fd2ba3c7e2', '2e48e556-601a-4633-a071-502dc77c53da', '395b48f6-eef0-446b-9e9d-524521dec2df', '59caff31-6cbf-41c0-a050-acaadcbeaf53', '5b5deb12-2261-4393-96d1-ae547c3c1c55', '5c65bfc8-30a3-44a5-b8de-5f7eb95aa0ff', '7bd0e417-d78d-4f88-ab84-fcf0cb2ac142', '9e6da676-09a5-499f-9f5c-710d36937808', 'ab077a77-7182-4540-8a58-d96ffc2c19c4', 'cd9f4c07-ced3-4f8e-b840-41bdcfd518ea', 'cdfdc830-1a10-46f0-835e-d33f7718242c', 'dc687afa-0b02-4fa4-9fda-9fdeded07733', 'dcfd062a-dc68-4fe5-9e4e-56c9d4dac9ba', 'de222c77-6c19-4bce-b13a-bb28251d91b7', 'e4f5f2b8-b3a3-4256-ae56-1a8f21606798', 'e5df1a65-5dfe-49a0-a7fc-4347150bd1df']",A 250 mV 8 kb 40 nm Ultra-Low Power 9T Supply Feedback SRAM (SF-SRAM),IEEE Journal of Solid-state Circuits,2011,4ad795f7-4732-4713-86f1-d009d465ccd5
"Evidential grids have recently been shown to have interesting properties for mobile object perception. Possessing only partial information is a frequent situation when driving in complex urban areas, and by making use of the Dempster-Shafer framework, evidential grids are able to handle partial information efficiently. This article deals with a lidar perception scheme that is enhanced by geo-referenced maps used as an additional source of information in a multi-grid fusion framework. The paper looks at the key stages of such a data fusion process and presents an adaptation of the conjunctive combination rule for refining the analysis of conflicting information. This method relies on temporal accumulation to distinguish between stationary and moving objects, and applies contextual discounting for modeling information obsolescence. As a result, the method is able to better characterize the state of the occupied cells by differentiating moving objects, parked cars, urban infrastructure and buildings. Another advantage of this approach is its ability to separate the drivable from the non-drivable free space. Experiments carried out in real traffic conditions with a specially equipped car illustrate the performance of this approach.","['Marek Kurdej', 'Julien Moras', 'Veronique Cherfaoui', 'Philippe Bonnifait']",4,"['0c6a9498-b0c1-4654-8e57-e61ecea2e2ed', '284584e5-2b50-40c6-8d77-6b2a5d8127b2', '2866e9ad-0bdb-43c2-a751-15d9af454e1d', '44ea6eea-9cad-4a43-af56-c923305b20f6', '5a54e861-f08c-4473-a9c7-907d0903228f', '7281bf61-46cd-4607-a9cf-3d91e6266dc9', '868ef8b7-1260-4d12-8569-95c50ea5b6d5', '92d23ac3-3fc0-46fb-95bb-20ce7a63b12d', '95d75076-1d3f-481f-8a4f-267c7b3802da', '9feecfa3-afc7-4317-b632-ecf89612d9f3', 'a42a620f-3f76-4e69-8a1c-2717863a8593', 'ac51d732-3fc0-47c7-9654-9300dfda4962', 'b85ba4e1-f0c7-4cd4-9fd9-e0e6b102b469', 'cfb2f8cf-4ee6-464d-9283-7c2def6a8ac4', 'd472cd66-eea7-4bee-9ca1-d0bf240d5661', 'e5e011a6-9ace-4efe-b3a8-a225a23e9d52', 'fac4a704-71c6-4bdf-965c-4d22c17168bf']",Map-Aided Evidential Grids for Driving Scene Understanding,IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Magazine,2015,4ad797a3-7b97-4341-8c72-55c83113e9bb
"In this manuscript, an interferential packet detection scheme in IEEE 802.11 WLANs is proposed. If another Basic Service Set (BSS) is overlapping domestic BSS, some Stations (STAs) may suffer from interference from a hidden terminal in overlapping BSS (OBSS). One of the best ways to avoid this undesirable situation is channel switching after detecting OBSS. However there are some difficulties to recognize existence of OBSS. One difficulty is that STAs in domestic BSS can't receive frames from OBSS correctly and can't check BSSID of frames if traffic in domestic BSS is heavy and if transmission rates of frames from OBSS are higher. Another difficulty is that if the cell radius of domestic BSS is smaller than that of OBSS, some STAs in OBSS may transmit frames asynchronously and interfere with transmissions in domestic BSS. If interference causes frame error, domestic STA can?t distinguish interference from degradation of channel condition. This paper proposes a method whereby STAs can detect interferential packet even while STAs receive frames from domestic BSS. If STAs detect interference, channel switching is performed dynamically. The probability of detecting interferential packets is evaluated by computer simulation, and the results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.","['Tomoya Tandai', 'Kiyoshi Toshimitsu', 'Takafumi Sakamoto']",3,"['14b569bb-cf5d-4f06-9bbe-a2f97a6c42cb', '2451f90f-9747-41e8-ac35-c6743c61e2ce', '315277c8-92d8-47e0-b3ce-767b5d94337f']",Interferential Packet Detection Scheme for a Solution to Overlapping BSS Issues in IEEE 802.11 WLANs,"personal, indoor and mobile radio communications",2006,4ad79d0d-a2db-4079-9f89-37139a080729

"The performance of radio-over-fiber optical transmission employing vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs), and further wireless transmission, of the two major ultra-wideband (UWB) implementations is reported when operating in the 60-GHz radio band. Performance is evaluated at 1.44 Gbit/s bitrate. The two UWB implementations considered employ dual-carrier modulation orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (DCM-OFDM) and binary phase-shift keying impulse radio (BPSK-IR) modulation respectively. Optical transmission distances up to 40 km in standard single-mode fiber and up to 500 m in bend-insensitive single-mode fiber with wireless transmission up to 5 m in both cases is demonstrated with no penalty. A simulation analysis has also been performed in order to investigate the operational limits. The analysis results are in excellent agreement with the experimental work and indicate good tolerance to chromatic dispersion due to the chirp characteristics of electro-optical conversion when a directly-modulated VCSEL is employed.

"A quad-band 2.5G receiver is designed to replace the front-end SAW filters with on-chip bandpass filters and to integrate the LNA matching components, as well as the RF baluns. The receiver achieves a typical sensitivity of -110 dBm or better, while saving a considerable amount of BOM. Utilizing an arrangement of four baseband capacitors and MOS switches driven by 4-phase 25% duty-cycle clocks, high-Q BPF's are realized to attenuate the 0 dBm out-of-band blocker. The 65 nm CMOS SAW-less receiver integrated as a part of a 2.5G SoC, draws 55 mA from the battery, and measures an out-of-band 1 dB-compression of greater than +2 dBm. Measured as a stand-alone, as well as the baseband running in call mode in the platform level, the receiver passes the 3GPP specifications with margin.","['Ahmad Mirzaei', 'Hooman Darabi', 'Ahmad Yazdi', 'Zhimin Zhou', 'Ethan Chang', 'Puneet Suri']",144,"['0786c6cd-f398-4ac1-a86f-dfa1f3c5e0db', '0cf649ff-37d2-4518-8576-b2e043359032', '430439f1-4a45-4032-b429-9d05f82f35ca', '5941a87a-2fc4-4e10-81aa-13895fbbc49d', '8c431aff-9045-4ced-9e68-d1fe6f8b0402', '94990d3b-b5f2-4d8b-b538-5d1eebbd27d9', 'bad190c6-3c84-4429-b298-26b0dcbf662d']",A 65 nm CMOS Quad-Band SAW-Less Receiver SoC for GSM/GPRS/EDGE,IEEE Journal of Solid-state Circuits,2011,4ad7dd6b-70fb-4745-8137-03b4af1de43f
"HER-2/neu (HER2) has been shown to be a valuable biomarker for breast cancer. However, inter-observer variability has been reported in the evaluation of HER2 with immunohistochemistry. It has been suggested that automated computer-based evaluation can provide a consistent and objective measure of HER2 expression. In this manuscript, we present an automated method for the quantitative assessment of HER2 using digital microscopy. The method employs imaging algorithms on whole slide images of tissue specimens for the extraction of two features describing HER2 membrane staining, namely membrane staining completeness and membrane staining intensity. A classifier was trained to merge the extracted features into an overall slide assessment score. Preliminary results showed good agreement with the provided truth. The developed automated method has the potential to be used as a computer aid for the immunohistochemical evaluation of HER2 expression with the objective of increasing observer reproducibility.","['Marios A.

"A system to add expressiveness to musical messages has been developed, starting from the results of acoustic and perceptual analyses. The system allows to obtain different performances, by modifying the acoustic parameters of a given neutral performance. The modification of the input performance is performed by a model that uses the hierarchical segmentation of the musical organization. For every hierarchical level, opportune curves are applied to the principal acoustic parameters. Level's self-similarity is the main criteria to construct the curves. The modular structure of the system defines an open architecture, where the rendering steps can be realized both with synthesis and post-processing techniques.

"This paper deals with the problem of fire detection in the presence of obstacles that are nontransparent to visible or infrared wavelengths. Exploiting the obstacle penetration capability of microwaves, a solution based on passive microwave radiometry has been proposed. To investigate such a solution, a theoretical model of the scene sensed by a microwave radiometer is developed, accounting for the presence of both fire spot and wall-like obstacles. By reversing the model's equations, it is possible to directly relate the obstacle emissivity, reflectivity, and transmissivity to the antenna noise temperatures measured in several conditions. These temperatures have been sensed with a portable low-cost instrument. The selected 12.65-GHz operation frequency features good wall penetration capability to be balanced with a reasonable antenna size. In order to verify the aforementioned model, several fire experiments have been carried out, resulting in an overall good agreement between measurements and developed theory. In particular, a 2-cm-thick plasterboard wall, typically used for indoor building construction, shows a transmissivity equal to 0.86 and can easily be penetrated by a microwave radiometer in the X-band.","['G.

"Model Predictive Control (MPC) has become widely accepted in industry. The reason for its success are manifold including easy implementation, ability to handle constraints, capacity to deal with nonlinearities, etc. However, the method does have drawbacks including tuning difficulties. In this paper, we propose an embellishment to the basic MPC strategy by incorporating a tuning parameter such that one can move continuously from an existing controller to a new MPC strategy. The continuous change of this tuning parameter leads to a continuously varying stabilizing control law. Since the proposed strategy allows one to slowly move from an existing control law to a new and better one, we term the strategy Predictive Metamorphic Control. For the case of an infinite horizon problem without constraints and for the general case with state and input constraints, stability results are established. The merits of the proposed method are illustrated by examples.","['He Kong', 'Graham C. Goodwin', 'María M.

"We consider the problem of bipartitioning a circuit into two balanced components that minimizes the number of crossing nets. Previously, the Kernighan and Lin type (K&L) heuristics, the simulated annealing approach, and the spectral method were given to solve the problem. However, network flow techniques were overlooked as a viable approach to min-cut balanced bipartition to due its high complexity. In this paper we propose a balanced bipartition heuristic based on repeated max-flow min-cut techniques, and give an efficient implementation that has the same asymptotic time complexity as that of one max-flow computation. We implemented our heuristic algorithm in a package called FBB. The experimental results demonstrate that FBB outperforms the K&L heuristics and the spectral method in terms of the number of crossing nets, and the efficient implementation makes it possible to partition large, circuit instances with reasonable runtime. For example, the average elapsed time for bipartitioning a circuit S35932 of almost 20K gates is less than 20 minutes.","['Honghua Hannah Yang', 'D. F.

"The problem of functional reconstruction of a polynomial system from its noisy time-series measurement is addressed in this paper. The reconstruction requires the determination of the embedding dimension and the unknown polynomial structure. The authors propose the use of genetic programming (GP) to find the exact functional form and embedding dimension of an unknown polynomial system from its time-series measurement. Using functional operators of addition, multiplication and time delay, they use GP to reconstruct the exact polynomial system and its embedding dimension. The proposed GP approach uses an improved least-squares (ILS) method to determine the parameters of a polynomial system. The ILS method is based on the orthogonal Euclidean distance to obtain an accurate parameter estimate when the series is corrupted by measurement noise. Simulations show that the proposed ILS-GP method can successfully reconstruct a polynomial system from its noisy time-series measurements.","['Vinay Varadan', 'Henry Leung']",50,"['8fb31045-1a2c-4a89-bdd6-b8fbcfad0987', 'c061069f-29d1-46d4-9974-dede8d5461f9']",Reconstruction of polynomial systems from noisy time-series measurements using genetic programming,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2001,4ad8a64c-7f0f-49e7-91e2-b2ca5b79389b

This paper presents a comparison between the computed fields induced in a 3.6-mm-resolution conductivity model of the human body by an external electric field and by several electrode source configurations involving the feet and either the head or shoulders. The application to cardiac pacemaker interference is also indicated.","['Trevor W. Dawson', 'Maria A.

"The problem of compensating an uncertain disturbance and/or tracking some reference signals for a general linear MIMO system is studied in this work using the robust regulation theory frame. The disturbances are assumed to be composed by a known number of distinct sinusoidal signals with unknown phases, amplitude and frequencies. Under suitable assumptions, an exponentially convergent estimator of the unknown disturbance parameters is proposed and introduced into the classical robust regulator design to obtain an adaptive controller. This controller guarantees that the closed-loop robust regulation is attained in some neighborhood of the nominal values of the parameters of system. A simulated example shows the validity of the proposed approach.","['Guillermo Obregon-Pulido', 'B. Castillo-Toledo', 'Alexander G.

"Abstract#R##N##R##N#A geographic information system (GIS) is presented in this work with the aim of helping the application of problem-based learning process to show the students how to adopt the appropriate decisions for the adaptation of architectural barriers to ensure the universal accessibility in public buildings. The GIS developed here consists of three layers based on vector maps corresponding to buildings, potential routes and architectural barriers. Hyperlinks in the last layer allow access to some relevant information about each barrier, such as type, description and adaptation cost. Several tests have been carried out to show the capability of the implemented GIS to locate indoor barriers, determine suitable indoor routes by considering criteria such as paths lengths or the total cost of barrier elimination, and update the information corresponding to each architectural barrier. In addition, the application of the proposed GIS has also been explored for indoor route guidance with promising results.

"In this paper, a practical location-aided routing method for sensor networks based on ultra-wideband (UWB) technique is proposed and evaluated. This method makes use of the positioning function of UWB and takes into account the energy consumption in the network. By modeling the property of energy consumption, we find that energy and quality-of-service (QOS) issues are greatly influenced by the route selected. Accordingly, a new routing algorithm is derived to search for energy-efficient routes that can support adequate QOS requirements. The simulation results have proved the advantages of this routing scheme.","['Xizhi An', 'Kyungsup Kwak']",0,"['0d4d0363-07b5-43b6-976d-955e96044709', '7b57a3f4-44a2-4fe3-9959-f25255669534', '7f8a1033-98d5-4370-9370-0b68f738dce8', 'dd7eeb46-21c7-443f-81ed-0f054b774637']",A Practical Location-aided Energy-aware Routing Method for UWB-based Sensor Networks,,2006,4ad96067-95f4-4287-9d94-784d171292f6

"We first describe a modification of Schnorr's identification scheme, in which the modulus is composite (instead of prime). This modification has some similarity with Brickell-McCurky's one, presented at the same conference. Then, by establishing a new set-up, we derive the first identity-based identification scheme based on discrete logarithms. More precisely, it is based on discrete logarithm modulo a composite number, a problem known to be harder than factorization problem. This scheme has interesting and somewhat paradoxical features. In particular, any user can choose his own secret, and, provided the parameters have convenient sizes, even the trusted center is unable to retrieve it from the public key (contrary to any identity-based scheme known until now).",['Marc Girault'],94,"['06c7458e-aa1c-4b6b-b400-e2416cd26897', '2523b6fa-aeb0-4242-86fd-ddf6d80787f6', '78f0a59a-ed8b-43b3-b498-f8c93227c8ad', '84535f53-8dd0-4de9-a99f-e0c570454697', 'b10fd24d-6a42-4821-9517-da6d1e14b17b']",An identity-based identification scheme based on discrete logarithms modulo a composite number,theory and application of cryptographic techniques,1991,4ad98a43-a825-4ae2-9d2e-7f4530ae9b52
"Pneumatic muscle has many advantages such as elasticity, high power and structural similarity to a living thing's muscle. There has been many researches to control robot actuated by pneumatic muscles, but conventional theories are hard to apply on real robot plants because of their assumptions and disregards of pneumatic muscle's physical aspects like size of pneumatic muscle and its controller. Here, the new method for saving space which is occupied by many controllers to operate robot actuated by pneumatic muscles is proposed. Actually there is easy way to control pneumatic muscle using the commercial proportional pressure regulator, but its size is not suitable to be embedded on stand alone robot. So, new method using the pressure switches of compact size and encoders is suggested. This new method is tested on a robot link with ball joints, actuated by four pneumatic muscles.","['Tae-Yong Choi', 'Joon-Yong Lee', 'Ju-Jang Lee']",16,"['0a81dca4-c5c9-4809-b666-7f5ffc4e8772', '42f59026-4e65-4fc2-be00-7fe7ab307fe5', '5fbdde1f-ff20-4463-8b16-c65052f819cc', '87562c8f-e208-4691-bf49-9a982869ef96', 'cadcc97e-0a4a-4fe7-9dfc-7a36efa4a097', 'd6fe0e45-f20b-4834-820c-5d45e2d65860', 'e2429bac-1750-4fa9-8a95-8327bdc80be3']",Control of Artificial Pneumatic Muscle for Robot Application,intelligent robots and systems,2006,4ad9dc73-5714-4af7-b9f5-20e80bed8db3
"Electronic document management (EDM) is a new form of information management. EDM is described to have certain business values in organizations, but no research has been found about EDM and Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SME). In this paper we present an ongoing investigation in two SMEs guided by the following research questions: ""How are electronic documents used in the SMEs? ""and ""What are the business needs of the SMEs, and how do they correspond with stated EDM business values?"". The study was carried out as two qualitative case studies in two SMEs in the north of Sweden. The results show that the business need for an SME corresponds with the business values of EDM. Yet is management of electronic document too dependent on individuals' competence, very complex when many systems are involved, and the context where the document is created is not preserved.

"This paper reports the detailed parameter space study of the nonlinear dynamical behaviors and their control in a time-delay digital tanlock loop (TDTL). At first, we explore the nonlinear dynamics of the TDTL in parameter space and show that beyond a certain value of loop gain parameter the system manifests bifurcation and chaos. Next, we consider two variants of the delayed feedback control (DFC) technique, namely, the time-delayed feedback control (TDFC) technique, and its modified version, the extended time-delayed feedback control (ETDFC) technique. Stability analyses are carried out to find out the stable phase-locked zone of the system for both the controlled cases. We employ two-parameter bifurcation diagrams and the Lyapunov exponent spectrum to explore the dynamics of the system in the global parameter space. We establish that the control techniques can extend the stable phase-locked region of operation by controlling the occurrence of bifurcation and chaos. We also derive an estimate of the optimum parameter values for which the controlled system has the fastest convergence time even for a larger acquisition range. The present study provides a necessary detailed parameter space study that will enable one to design an improved TDTL system.","['Tanmoy Banerjee', 'Bishwajit Paul', 'B. C.

"This paper proposes a triphasic model of intact skin in vivo based on a general phenomenological thermohydromechanical and physicochemical (THMPC) approach of heterogeneous media. The skin is seen here as a deforming stratified medium composed of four layers and made out of different fluid-saturated materials which contain also an ionic component. All the layers are treated as linear, isotropic materials described by their own behaviour law. The numerical simulations of in vivo indentation test performed on human skin are given. The numerical results correlate reasonably well with the typical observations of indented human skin. The discussion shows the versatility of this approach to obtain a better understanding on the mechanical behaviour of human skin layers separately.","['Marie-Angèle Abellan', 'H.

"In this paper, we develop a transmit power adaptation method that maximizes the total data rate of multiuser orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems in a downlink transmission. We generally formulate the data rate maximization problem by allowing that a subcarrier could be shared by multiple users. The transmit power adaptation scheme is derived by solving the maximization problem via two steps: subcarrier assignment for users and power allocation for subcarriers. We have found that the data rate of a multiuser OFDM system is maximized when each subcarrier is assigned to only one user with the best channel gain for that subcarrier and the transmit power is distributed over the subcarriers by the water-filling policy. In order to reduce the computational complexity in calculating water-filling level in the proposed transmit power adaptation method, we also propose a simple method where users with the best channel gain for each subcarrier are selected and then the transmit power is equally distributed among the subcarriers. Results show that the total data rate for the proposed transmit power adaptation methods significantly increases with the number of users owing to the multiuser diversity effects and is greater than that for the conventional frequency-division multiple access (FDMA)-like transmit power adaptation schemes. Furthermore, we have found that the total data rate of the multiuser OFDM system with the proposed transmit power adaptation methods becomes even higher than the capacity of the AWGN channel when the number of users is large enough.","['Jiho Jang', 'Kwang Bok Lee']",1643,"['0fea8a1a-6c77-47ac-8c13-081dad8cdb66', '253df6ac-3dce-4fe5-bada-d14d733c0935', '99546874-b6cb-47b6-83ff-370b5d53974b', 'ecf7088f-2ecc-466b-b2c2-c66567340c2d']",Transmit power adaptation for multiuser OFDM systems,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,2003,4ada66b8-5b5b-4f55-972d-d7742abde801

"Motion and behavior analysis of social insects such as ants requires tracking many ants over time. This process is highly labor-intensive and tedious. Automatic tracking is challenging as ants often interact with one another, resulting in frequent occlusions that cause drifts in tracking. In addition, tracking many objects is computationally expensive. In this paper, we present a robust and efficient method for tracking multiple ants. We first prevent drifts by maximizing the coverage of foreground pixels at at global scale. Secondly, we improve speed by reducing markov chain length through dynamically changing the target proposal distribution for perturbed ant selection. Using a real dataset with ground truth, we demonstrate that our algorithm was able to improve the accuracy by 15% (resulting in 98% tracking accuracy) and the speed by 76%.","['Mary Fletcher', 'Anna Dornhaus', 'Min C.

"Juxtacrine signaling is intercellular communication, in which the receptor of the signal (typically a protein) as well as the ligand (also typically a protein, responsible for the activation of the receptor) are anchored in the plasma membranes, so that in this type of signaling the activation of the receptor depends on direct contact between the membranes of the cells involved. Juxtacrine signaling is present in many important cellular events of several organisms, especially in the development process. We propose a generic formal model (a modeling framework) for juxtacrine signaling systems that is a class of dynamic discrete systems. It possesses desirable characteristics in a good modeling framework, such as: a) structural similarity with biological models, b) capacity of operating in different scales of time and c) capacity of explicitly treating both the events and molecular elements that occur in the membrane, and those that occur in the intracellular environment and are involved in the juxtacrine signaling process.

"DIY vision for the design of a smart and customizable world in the form of IoT demands the involvement of general public in its development process. General public lacks the technical depths for programming state-of-the-art prototyping and development kits. Latest IoT kits, for example, Intel Edison, are revolutionizing the DIY paradigm for IoT and more than ever a DIY intuitive programming interface is required to enable masses to interact with and customize the behavior of remote IoT devices on the Internet. This paper presents the novel implementation of such a system enabling general public to customize the behavior of remote IoT devices through a visual interface. The interface enables the visualization of the resources exposed by a remote CoAP device in the form of graphical virtual objects. The VOs are used to create service design through simple operations like drag-and-drop and properties settings. The design is maintained as an XML document, thus being easily distributable and recognizable. CoAP proxy acts as an operation client for the remote device and also provides communication link between the designer and the device.

"In the field of search, the application of ontology is an important research topic. Introduction of ontology technology in the retrieval system with massive data can make the searching results more comprehensive. However, now days the ontology is constructed by domain experts, and there are a lot of shortcomings, such as complex process, long time for the project, and difficulty to update. Thereby, in this paper, a method of semiautomaticly building ontology is proposed, after synthetically analyzing a variety of methods and techniques about it. The building process which is based on user interests, mines not only the concepts but also the potential relationships between concepts from the texts by the method of concepts clustering. On the basis of such research, an unique patent information retrieval system based on ontology has been completed.","['Wenwen Yi', 'Yong Sun', 'Shukui Zhang', 'Yingfeng Wu', 'Zhenhua Chu']",50,"['1eb5e0d7-dee1-4d4c-936e-9e587b58b6e1', '29519f6e-2628-4740-956c-5377756f603f', '4d026afc-e08b-4c51-9ff3-6e871f746676', '620150d0-8acf-467e-b69d-dd831c5b59c9']",The Application and Research of Ontology Construction Technology,workshop on knowledge discovery and data mining,2008,4adb169f-a2b6-4cc1-b3e4-6b677ea757e4
"This paper analyses the citations from Intelligent Systems in Accounting, Finance and Management that have occurred in ISI's Web of Knowledge in February 2010. I found roughly 1000 citations to the journal under 10 different journal name abbreviations, with roughly 25p of the citations occurring during 2008–2009, associated with 27 of the more frequently cited papers. Using that citation data, the H-index and the 40 (42 with ties) most-cited papers are presented. I found that ISI's new proceedings data appear to have a different citation pattern than ISI's journal citation data, resulting in citations to more sources, but fewer citations per source. I also examine the research methodologies and applications of the most-cited papers in an attempt to determine what areas have been cited most and where there are potential gaps in the research.

"In recent years, significant research has been devoted to the development of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) able to detect anomalous computer network traffic indicative of malicious activity. While signature-based IDS have proven effective in discovering known attacks, anomaly-based IDS hold the even greater promise of being able to automatically detect previously undocumented threats. Traditional IDS are generally trained in batch mode, and therefore cannot adapt to evolving network data streams in real time. To resolve this limitation, data stream mining techniques can be utilized to create a new type of IDS able to dynamically model a stream of network traffic. In this paper, we present two methods for anomalous network packet detection based on the data stream mining paradigm. The first of these is an adapted version of the DenStream algorithm for stream clustering specifically tailored to evaluate network traffic. In this algorithm, individual packets are treated as points and are flagged as normal or abnormal based on their belonging to either normal or outlier clusters. The second algorithm utilizes a histogram to create a model of the evolving network traffic to which incoming traffic can be compared using Pearson correlation. Both of these algorithms were tested using the first week of data from the DARPA ’99 dataset with Generic HTTP, Shell-code and Polymorphic attacks inserted. We were able to achieve reasonably high detection rates with moderately low false positive percentages for different types of attacks, though detection rates varied between the two algorithms. Overall, the histogram-based detection algorithm achieved slightly superior results, but required more parameters than the clustering-based algorithm. As a result of its fewer parameter requirements, the clustering approach can be more easily generalized to different types of network traffic streams.","['Zachary Miller', 'William Deitrick', 'Wei Hu']",50,"['4454b413-4ed5-4ba5-839f-3f9017c15186', '45a5b151-e26b-4c2b-bd06-e32aa73cc658', '54ea0b38-cc55-4aa8-ab90-f7a3a5837a29', '84a42daa-31f6-47fe-a98d-562f53bec8f5', '8878b3b6-7eff-435c-8798-4f55ae0a22a6', '90bb9140-a9d2-4743-aebb-897608992c9b', 'de892430-1b34-4d9e-8213-9c11a592bc54', 'f049a14c-41b0-4c46-9d8d-c336600e6daf']",Anomalous Network Packet Detection Using Data Stream Mining,Journal of Information Security,2011,4adb4360-0938-47d7-a1fc-8cecb527be9d

"The automated categorization (or classification) of texts into predefined categories has witnessed a booming interest in the last 10 years, due to the increased availability of documents in digital form and the ensuing need to organize them. In the research community the dominant approach to this problem is based on machine learning techniques: a general inductive process automatically builds a classifier by learning, from a set of preclassified documents, the characteristics of the categories. The advantages of this approach over the knowledge engineering approach (consisting in the manual definition of a classifier by domain experts) are a very good effectiveness, considerable savings in terms of expert labor power, and straightforward portability to different domains. This survey discusses the main approaches to text categorization that fall within the machine learning paradigm. We will discuss in detail issues pertaining to three different problems, namely, document representation, classifier construction, and classifier evaluation.",['Fabrizio

Driving situation awareness-based fuzzy rule bases are developed to make intelligent decisions on the power split function. A charge sustenance strategy is developed in parallel to maintain adequate reserves of energy in the storage device for supporting an extended range of driving.

"This paper is concerned with adaptation capabilities of evolved neural controllers. We propose to evolve mechanisms for parameter self-organization instead of evolving the parameters themselves. The method consists of encoding a set of local adaptation rules that synapses follow while the robot freely moves in the environment. In the experiments presented here, the performance of the robot is measured in environments that are different in significant ways from those used during evolution. The results show that evolutionary adaptive controllers solve the task much faster and better than evolutionary standard fixed-weight controllers, that the method scales up well to large architectures, and that evolutionary adaptive controllers can adapt to environmental changes that involve new sensory characteristics (including transfer from simulation to reality and across different robotic platforms) and new spatial relationships.","['J.

"We characterize the symmetric capacity of the two-user Gaussian interference channel with feedback to within 1 bit/s/Hz. The result makes use of a deterministic model to provide insights into the Gaussian channel. We derive a new outer bound to show that a proposed scheme can achieve the symmetric capacity to within one bit for all channel parameters. One consequence of the result is that feedback provides unbounded gain, i.e., the gain becomes arbitrarily large for certain channel parameters. It is a surprising result because feedback has been so far known to provide no gain in memoryless point-to-point channels and only power gain (bounded gain) in the multiple access channels. The gain comes from using feedback to fully exploit the side information provided by the broadcast nature of the wireless medium.","['Changho Suh', 'David Tse']",50,"['2659531e-eb9d-4dd5-b46f-10f66a4819c6', '58c8fd74-cd1b-4a05-b3c5-ab5bd08c0aed', '7213d99b-7f5c-4877-85e4-4a9c2afa2482', '7ae0e791-2e2b-4504-a2fe-caa9b0589c44', 'bcd93723-bebc-49fe-a0cc-861fe9d812cf', 'c43832e1-b3e2-415f-9f39-4ad8e609262d', 'd03c481d-ce53-415b-b250-d4f745ecbf6d', 'e6929043-e58a-441d-8937-92db518e6dc6', 'e9cd70b9-67e2-43f1-a840-38db7713b194', 'ff06b6b1-6408-438b-a879-3ff2d59452c0']",Symmetric feedback capacity of the Gaussian interference channel to within one bit,international symposium on information theory,2009,4adb8fb6-e841-4ee5-99c2-70954698af93

"We show that spatial joins are very suitable to be processed on a parallel hardware platform. The parallel system is equipped with a so called shared virtual memory which is well suited for the design and implementation of parallel spatial join algorithms. We start with an algorithm that consists of three phases: task creation, task assignment and parallel task execution. In order to reduce CPU and I/O cost, the three phases are processed in a fashion that preserves spatial locality. Dynamic load balancing is achieved by splitting tasks into smaller ones and reassigning some of the smaller tasks to idle processors. In an experimental performance comparison, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of several variants of our algorithm. The most efficient one shows an almost optimal speed up under the assumption that the number of disks is sufficiently large.","['Thomas Brinkhoff', 'Hans-Peter Kriegel', 'Bernhard Seeger']",161,"['2d1bc1b0-e535-4cf6-84d7-f4263b49a412', '34c2f9a5-a5be-46d7-b539-5e3cbfd4aab9', '47d0e8d9-79e9-4584-bffb-35937bcd29d3', '77fc21e5-bca1-45a5-9f74-1adc322989a8', '7a637d7e-cc37-4278-a5bf-ce3661788c2c', '93e184c7-b8b9-468f-8533-a2056659f5ce', 'a8cd74d7-c69b-44a4-90bd-00da0f64905d', 'b2d48a35-ceab-4fc3-8a72-d1bb265c779d', 'b8ea6de1-8940-48bd-af03-14915a703aa3', 'c16c2977-7c76-4d59-a55e-e23e4728f19b', 'd10f840c-1003-48b5-8aec-3ecc0957c658', 'd223c172-f468-43e6-ad09-f3a528d27a00', 'e5656f7c-bf77-4303-b8e9-8b51b0bf9089', 'eb430105-9adc-4cbd-977b-c166465f976d']",Parallel processing of spatial joins using R-trees,international conference on data engineering,1996,4adbb8d9-a791-4f06-8426-845d6b91ef37
"Service composition is an important means for integrating the individual Web services for creating new value added systems that satisfy complex demands. Since, Web services exist in the heterogeneous environments on the Internet, study on how to guarantee the reliability of service composition in a distributed, dynamic and complex environment becomes more and more important. This paper proposes a service composition net(SCN) and fault-tolerant strategy to improve the reliability of service composition. The strategy consists of static strategy, dynamic strategy and exception handling mechanism, which can be used to dynamically adjust component service for achieving good reliability as well as good overall performance. SCN is adopted to model different components of service composition. The fault detection and fault recovery mechanisms are also considered. Based on the constructed model, theories of Petri nets help prove the consistency of processing states and the effectiveness of the strategy. A case study of Export Service illustrates the feasibility of proposed method.","['Huiqun Yu', 'Guisheng Fan', 'Liqiong Chen', 'Dongmei Liu']",50,"['053f7293-377e-42e0-bd71-d8445daff956', '0697277c-f339-48cd-b805-b6c8ce59c211', '58954850-7b29-4bf3-b8e2-7465244e2a83', '68174169-acbe-4c78-9dfe-7f82192c85c3', '6ec76dc5-338d-4b4f-83f5-55615416a2df', 'a2ffabcf-2580-4a71-bf77-00332b4e8707', 'bdce9352-60ec-42d8-b4f0-e6a6a620cbba', 'c30f907e-ab0f-4910-9afe-1461ee759d71', 'c526ff7b-6006-4146-a3b5-9d3c58b57645', 'deace233-bdf8-4367-a99a-04cf83d6a5e3']",A Fault-Tolerant Strategy for Improving the Reliability of Service Composition,international conference on quality software,2010,4adbcb62-4d9f-4d8c-9eb7-0b4c4263bb6b

"The problem of the commutativity of algebraic (categorical) diagrams has attracted the attention of researchers for a long time. For example, the related notion of coherence was discussed in Mac Lane's homology book Mac Lane (1963), see also his AMS presidential address Mac Lane (1976). Researchers in category theory view this problem from a specific angle, and for them it is not just a question of convenient notation, though it is worth mentioning the important role that notation plays in the development of science (take, for example, the progress made after the introduction of symbolic notation in logics or matrix notation in algebra). In 1976, Peter Freyd published the paper 'Properties Invariant within Equivalence Types of Categories' (Freyd 1976), where the central role is played by the notion of a 'diagrammatic property'. We may also recall the process of 'diagram chasing', and its applications in topology and algebra. But before we can use diagrams (and the principal property of a diagram is its commutativity), it is vital for us to be able to check whether a diagram is commutative.","['Ralph Matthes', 'Sergei Soloviev']",0,[],Preface to the special issue: Commutativity of algebraic diagrams,Mathematical Structures in Computer Science,2012,4adbdb99-064b-4ce3-8c20-f2fdb7d3abd5
"We describe a new approach for performing pseudo-imaging of point energy sources from spectral-temporal sensor data. Pseudo-imaging, which involves the automatic localization, spectrum estimation, and identification of energetic sources, can be difficult for dim sources and/or noisy images, or in data containing multiple sources which are closely spaced such that their signatures overlap. The new approach is specifically designed for these difficult cases. It is developed within the framework of modeling field theory (MFT), a biologically-inspired neural network system that has demonstrated practical value in many diverse areas. MFT performs an efficient optimization over the space of all model parameters and mappings between image pixels and sources, or clutter. The optimized set of parameters is then used for detection, localization and identification of the multiple sources in the data. The paper includes results computed from experimental spectrometer data.","['Ross Deming', 'Shawn Higbee', 'Derek Dwyer', 'Michael Welser', 'Leonid I.

"Diagnosing exceptions in multi-agent systems (MAS) is a complex task due to the distributed nature of the data and control in such systems. This complexity is exacerbated in open environments where independently developed autonomous agents interact with each other in order to achieve their goals. Inevitably, exceptions would occur in such MAS and these exceptions can arise at one of three levels, namely environmental, knowledge and social levels. In this paper we propose a novel exception diagnosis system that is able to analyse and detect exceptions effectively. The proposed architecture consists of specialised exception diagnosis agents called sentinel agents. The sentinel agents are equipped with knowledge of observable abnormal situations, their underlying causes, and resolution strategies associated with these causes. The sentinel agent applies a heuristic classification approach to collect related data from affected agents in order to uncover the underlying causes of the observed symptoms. We illustrate and evaluate our proposed architecture using an agent-based grid computing case study.","['Nazaraf Shah', 'Kuo Ming Chao', 'Nick Godwin', 'Muhammad Younas', 'Christopher Laing']",50,"['2eb6f0ce-8807-4e69-b2ca-ed27a4813767', '4530763e-cfd0-4cc0-9d26-f777c575d3a2', '4fb22fec-3a49-42a3-9922-bf2beea290f4', '5ff5401a-0dc8-4e2b-b5ad-e994b833c79c', 'c72d3bde-7cca-46a2-8d0b-66bc5e1d23c7', 'ea6a2d0c-ac2e-4e84-99ec-23a976dc3f18']",Exception diagnosis in agent-based grid computing,"systems, man and cybernetics",2004,4adbed19-076e-49a3-ae29-df75b6a3b4b2
In this paper we will extend the definition of a filled function and propose a new definition of a locally filled function. The difference between the locally filled function and the classical filled function is illustrated by an example. The existence of a locally filled function is also studied in theory. Based on the locally filled function and cluster analysis technique we will present a hybrid global optimisation algorithm. The algorithm integrates the deterministic and stochastic searching techniques and has a very powerful globally searching ability. Numerical performance of the new hybrid algorithm is demonstrated by two examples about the Shubert I and Sine-Square I functions.,"['Hong–xuan Huang', 'Yu Zhao']",0,"['0fe5c5f2-39a4-4f58-ac66-0316ce875294', '136ea0ee-6a7b-4daa-8aad-043a3b6e70b7', 'a03d51ab-a67e-4bc6-a2f6-6c8e10f9dd8d', 'a37cb754-3875-495a-bb09-57e180d68aba', 'e5c2b30a-4496-4167-8bf2-697877d53097']",A hybrid global optimisation algorithm based on locally filled functions and cluster analysis,computational science and engineering,2007,4adc162e-2b15-4d8b-85ea-5cd63b17dee5
"On the Internet many different paths exist between each source and destination. When single path routing is used these paths can be under utilized, not used fairly or not used at all. One way to overcome this is to allow multipath routing. But when multiple paths are used TCP congestion control can be negatively affected and cause poor goodput performance due to the reordering of packets. We proposeMATCP (Multipath Aware TCP) which makes modifications to TCP that allows it to monitor and select which path it takes through the network for each flow. MATCP is compared to single path routing and is validated using extensive simulation. MATCP is found to greatly improve fairness between flows while providing equal or better utilization of links than single best path networks.","['Peter Dimopoulos', 'Panlop Zeephongsekul', 'Zahir Tari']",7,"['07baa066-d814-4452-bfc1-3c9a06f1c824', '0c44fee0-b5e8-46ab-b257-78546046cd48', '2fccf568-310b-42dd-8ef4-52be58ffe5cd', '612f07f6-a48e-4063-b6a0-9ce6e22f0d9d', '8df0f1e0-c75c-4c63-81d9-b8ab58daa4fd', 'a071934e-8b94-4fc6-8d2b-0a3ff924f91a']",Multipath Aware TCP (MATCP),international symposium on computers and communications,2006,4adc31b8-3460-4cf2-a9a1-02de3ff3b50e

"The increasing complexity of real time software has led to a recent trend in the use of high level modeling languages for development of real time software. One representative example is the modeling language ROOM (real time object oriented modeling), which provides features such as object orientation, state machine description of behaviors, formal semantics for executability of models, and possibility of automated code generation. However these modeling languages largely ignore the timeliness aspect of real time systems, and fail to provide any guidance for a designer to a priori predict and analyze temporal behavior. We consider schedulability analysis for automated implementations of ROOM models, based on the ObjecTime toolset. This work builds on results presented by M. Saksena (1997), where we developed some guidelines for the design and implementation of real time object oriented models. Using the guidelines, we have modified the run time system library provided by the ObjecTime toolset to make it amenable to schedulability analysis. Based on the modified toolset, we show how a ROOM model can be analyzed for schedulability, taking into account the implementation overheads and structure. The analysis is validated experimentally, first using simple periodic models, and then using a large case study of a train tilting system.","['Manas Saksena', 'A Ptak', 'Paul D.

"This paper presents a novel people detection and tracking method based on a multi-modal sensor fusion approach that utilizes 2D laser range and camera data. The data points in the laser scans are clustered using a novel graph-based method and an SVM based version of the cascaded AdaBoost classifier is trained with a set of geometrical features of these clusters. In the detection phase, the classified laser data is projected into the camera image to define a region of interest for the vision-based people detector. This detector is a fast version of the Implicit Shape Model (ISM) that learns an appearance codebook of local SIFT descriptors from a set of hand-labeled images of pedestrians and uses them in a voting scheme to vote for centers of detected people. The extension consists in a fast and detailed analysis of the spatial distribution of voters per detected person. Each detected person is tracked using a greedy data association method and multiple Extended Kalman Filters that use different motion models. This way, the filter can cope with a variety of different motion patterns. The tracker is asynchronously updated by the detections from the laser and the camera data. Experiments conducted in real-world outdoor scenarios with crowds of pedestrians demonstrate the usefulness of our approach.","['Luciano Spinello', 'Rudolph Triebel', 'Roland Siegwart']",50,"['0289a1a7-579b-42a8-8795-45bb59850e67', '04d8a9cb-a14d-4ccf-8b19-da1327e86b91', '1e052b04-e4c9-41de-b6c6-73e4f06e90ce', '276c4b24-bf26-4171-b5d4-43bf0b5f2651', '310cbba4-d88d-4bf4-a4f2-738f91b5f8c8', '334f3938-338d-4988-84c9-faccdc037070', '369fa124-50eb-4922-a9ec-6902c4674688', '3bd27125-b3a4-49e7-bd61-12446f6820e5', '55839982-d604-45fa-afdb-bfca41d3bd06', '6f6fe122-6003-498c-a584-b27b3f7a6be3', '8023c670-2f71-4ebd-83d5-a986586a4e4b', '8b8a2247-bd77-4736-b493-449734f56b9a', '8d8e7d51-3223-4776-bf6a-40306774b8a1', '8f3c17db-e815-495e-8fae-c191d03c4455', '90ef9074-bd72-4b31-b9c0-0c20e3e7eb2e', '92186a00-589b-45b5-afa8-3b037cc9b381', '9ac3cc6e-6128-4687-898d-61070dc0c065', 'a51fa2f9-2e1f-4070-9a5d-3951da3287c0', 'a6e89e6a-0d15-4b27-bca5-0c801740c4ac', 'b29cb808-1f59-40e9-8afa-26a3701b6284', 'b74dc1b6-581e-44ea-b30a-38f0d99dc332', 'b944f77f-113b-4a02-ae5e-d4a124b8fd5b', 'bf2bce20-6be7-4073-a565-b09238200177', 'db26488d-78be-44b1-a343-e896f43c5d29', 'f006e236-59ad-4647-a59f-4f46dc2c85be', 'f3959783-a9aa-48a2-9fcc-978879de365e']",Multimodal people detection and tracking in crowded scenes,national conference on artificial intelligence,2008,4adc4b73-ab48-4c55-a115-e28a8d052728
"We aim to produce predictive models that are not only accurate, but are also interpretable to human experts. Our models are decision lists, which consist of a series of if ...then...statements (e.g., if high blood pressure, then stroke) that discretize a high-dimensional, multivariate feature space into a series of simple, readily interpretable decision statements. We introduce a generative model called Bayesian Rule Lists that yields a posterior distribution over possible decision lists. It employs a novel prior structure to encourage sparsity. Our experiments show that Bayesian Rule Lists has predictive accuracy on par with the current top algorithms for prediction in machine learning. Our method is motivated by recent developments in personalized medicine, and can be used to produce highly accurate and interpretable medical scoring systems. We demonstrate this by producing an alternative to the CHADS2 score, actively used in clinical practice for estimating the risk of stroke in patients that have atrial fibrillation. Our model is as interpretable as CHADS2, but more accurate.","['Benjamin Letham', 'Cynthia Rudin', 'Tyler H.

"Joint source and channel (JSC) coding using combined trellis coded quantization (TCQ) and continuous phase modulation (CPM) is studied. The channel is assumed to be the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Optimal soft decoding for JSC coding using jointly designed TCQ/CPM is studied in this paper. The soft decoder is based on the a posteriori probability (APP) algorithm for trellis coded CPM. It is shown that the systems with soft decoding outperform the systems with hard decoding especially when the systems operate at low to medium signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, a TCQ design algorithm for the noisy channel is developed. It has been demonstrated that the combined TCQ/CPM systems are both power and bandwidth efficient compared with the combined TCQ/TCM/8PSK systems. The novelty of this work is the use of a soft decoder and the APP algorithm for combined TCQ/CPM systems.","['Zihuai Lin', 'Tor Aulin']",0,"['088d5317-0bb1-4930-a8f4-e054a4b5d402', '1967d037-37e7-4fea-a18f-3ab0c9ad19e3', '1f662236-9a84-4671-bd1e-483e9e0b764d', '75c3b88b-32fc-49de-962c-991348bcccaf', '7fcb2263-dd42-4e54-80d0-fb3bfb6eaba8', '9ec287ca-9bbf-4b96-96e3-fdb78a808228', 'a7e6779f-f4fc-44d5-85a7-4592a5fbe639', 'a9df77e2-65aa-4119-a477-43659c028dce', 'f48a79df-1675-4858-912b-fb60d340a2a3']",Joint source and channel coding using trellis coded CPM: soft decoding,data compression conference,2005,4adca288-2cc0-435e-83a5-ecfdc99b8894

"To detect a human body and recognize its posture, a component-based approach is less susceptible to changes in posture and lighting conditions. This paper proposes a component-based human-body model that comprises ten components and their flexible links. Each component contains geometrical information, appearance information, and information on the links with other components. The proposed method in this paper uses hierarchical links between components of human body, so that it allows to make coarse-to-fine searches and makes human-body matching more time-efficient. To adaptively estimate the posture in change of posture and illumination, we update the component online every time a new human body is incoming.",['Kyoung-Mi Lee'],0,"['04d8a9cb-a14d-4ccf-8b19-da1327e86b91', '5bf944dd-a944-4fdb-a02e-e5c145f04372', '82cf52b0-c1d8-4147-b496-451ef66c5825', '9f84e529-87a3-42f1-9d63-9af710f40925', 'af0ff418-fc64-4381-b4be-8278a577d7d5', 'c13da71d-2869-400b-bb02-8961c399fcc1']",Adaptive estimation of human posture using a component-based model,international conference on pattern recognition,2005,4adca8e6-d7ff-4559-9391-9951a39cb37d

The fading coefficients under both (a1) and (a2) are studied under an appropriate small scale channel model that is used in the CDMA cellular systems, namely Nakagami channel model. To do so, we derive a closed- form expression of the average utility function which represents the number of bits received correctly at the receiver per one Joule expended.

"Most current approaches towards information security education do not have a sound theoretical basis. This could lead to the failure of these educational programs. Furthermore, the need for information security knowledge is no longer only of concern to organizations, but has also become a concern for individuals using online services for personal entertainment, social networking, banking, and other activities. Thus, there is a need for “cyber security” education for both individuals and organizations. Such cyber security educational programs should be based on sound pedagogical theories. One such a pedagogically sound approach that could potentially play a role in cyber security educational programs is “brain compatible learning”. This paper will perform a critical evaluation of an existing information security education course, and evaluate the subject matter in terms of brain compatible learning approaches. The aim of the paper is to propose a set of brain compatible learning guidelines for the creation of cyber security educational material.

"Abstraction is a powerful form of domain knowledge that allows reinforcement-learning agents to cope with complex environments, but in most cases a human must supply this knowledge. In the absence of such prior knowledge or a given model, we propose an algorithm for the automatic discovery of state abstraction from policies learned in one domain for use in other domains that have similar structure. To this end, we introduce a novel condition for state abstraction in terms of the relevance of state features to optimal behavior, and we exhibit statistical methods that detect this condition robustly. Finally, we show how to apply temporal abstraction to benefit safely from even partial state abstraction in the presence of generalization error.","['Nicholas K.

An expression can be implemented in several ways, which differ in the degree of factorization. A number of selected implementations is evaluated and the one with minimal cost (area or delay) is chosen.

"In the field of image watermarking, research has been mainly focused on grayscale image watermarking, whereas the extension to the color case is usually accomplished by marking the image luminance, or by processing each color channel separately. A DCT domain watermarking technique expressly designed to exploit the peculiarities of color images is presented. The watermark is hidden within the data by modifying a subset of full-frame DCT coefficients of each color channel. Detection is based on a global correlation measure which is computed by taking into account the information conveyed by the three color channels as well as their interdependency. To ultimately decide whether or not the image contains the watermark, the correlation value is compared to a threshold. With respect to existing grayscale algorithms, a new approach to threshold selection is proposed, which permits reducing the probability of missed detection to a minimum, while ensuring a given false detection probability. Experimental results, as well as theoretical analysis, are presented to demonstrate the validity of the new approach with respect to algorithms operating on image luminance only.","['Mauro Barni', 'Franco Bartolini', 'Alessandro Piva']",168,"['03af9aac-6e25-4ee9-981a-d45e7854c07c', '45abd8c1-38ec-44e4-bd25-2e467ef30e6e', '4936c005-d94e-4821-ab60-71a2b6d02b4a', '54651d5d-91e2-48a7-9d88-d4c2ac8c4e71', '559445a0-b91d-4bf8-b5d9-a24ff3bedf83', '6e0a84f6-1fcf-4da8-befc-2dfec161823f', 'b77a7526-a67b-44d1-9fe5-38b8c19f8dbc', 'bcd8f34e-1751-48fc-a860-c826c821e6ad', 'd4e86eda-1bb0-4e9a-8aec-163bd3b02305', 'da1b6600-6a52-4dd4-9b25-97e4221e3e29', 'e4771f15-14ab-4805-b62d-2bba9c185e73', 'f9c799fc-c3ba-41f1-9dab-d1b7525bb5eb', 'fb30a901-0c77-4e62-805c-7b30f33208dc']",Multichannel watermarking of color images,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology,2002,4addecba-0cd7-4b47-aedd-7041a023aaec
"Top-down attention is modeled as decision making based on incomplete information. We consider decisions made in a sequential measurement situation where initially only an incomplete input feature vector is available, however, where we are given the possibility to acquire additional input values among the missing features. The procecure thus poses the question what to do next? We take an information theoretical approach implemented for generality in a generative mixture model. The framework allows us reduce the decision about what to measure next in a classification problem to the estimation of a few one-dimensional integrals per missing feature. We demonstrate the viability of the framework on four well-known classification problems.","['Lars Kai Hansen', 'Seliz G.

"Handwriting Recognition enables a person to scribble something on a piece of paper and then convert it into text. If we look into the practical reality there are enumerable styles in which a character may be written. These styles can be self combined to generate more styles. Even if a small child knows the basic styles a character can be written, he would be able to recognize characters written in styles intermediate between them or formed by their mixture. This motivates the use of Genetic Algorithms for the problem. In order to prove this, we made a pool of images of characters. We converted them to graphs. The graph of every character was intermixed to generate styles intermediate between the styles of parent character. Character recognition involved the matching of the graph generated from the unknown character image with the graphs generated by mixing. Using this method we received an accuracy of 98.44%.","['Rahul Kala', 'Harsh Vazirani', 'Anupam Shukla', 'Ritu Tiwari']",5,"['300db65d-e813-4593-9613-c37bcb58e130', '771f22ee-78ee-47d7-ae23-a6039720f3c9', 'ef3cd714-aaa9-4c1c-9790-1c662858b3b5', 'f14e340f-da9e-4a33-a5e4-945c7bb8a5ac']",Offline Handwriting Recognition using Genetic Algorithm,arXiv: Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,2010,4ade41cc-046b-4c01-b4bf-45477fbf711c
"Classification of mental tasks from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals has important applications in brain-computer interfacing (BCI). However, classification of the highly redundant and high-dimensional EEG signal, with high spatial and spectral correlations, is quite challenging. Therefore, the discriminant information, especially that of the first and second data moments, need to be extracted in the form of uncorrelated features. This work addresses this need by approximating a linear minimal-dimension sufficient statistic of the EEG matrix data in both spatial and spectral domains. As a result of the two-dimensional spatio-temporal approach and the generalized sufficiency approximation, a significant improvement on the classification accuracy is achieved.","['Mohammad Shahin Mahanta', 'Amirhossein S.

"The optimal synthesis of private telecommunication networks subject to multiple nonsimultaneous demands is considered. A model is given for the multiservice network synthesis model with an accurate representation of the conversion and access costs, while maintaining a classical multicommodity flow representation of the network. This is done by increasing the original network to produce an augmented network. Two decomposition methods for solving the network synthesis problem are presented. The first one is a classical Lagrangian relaxation method and the second is a resource-decomposition-type technique. Some preliminary computational results in both cases are presented. These show that the two methods converge within reasonable computation times.

"Current internet research has been influenced by application developers and computer engineers who see the development of the Web as being divided into three different stages: Web 1.0, Web 2.0 and Web 3.0. This article will argue that this understanding – although important when analysing the political economy of the Web – can have serious limitations when applied to everyday contexts and the lived experience of technologies. Drawing from the context of the Italian student movement, we show that the division between Web 1.0, Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 is often deconstructed by activists’ media practices. Therefore, we highlight the importance of developing an approach that – by focusing on practice – draws attention to the interplay between Web platforms rather than their transition.

"Visual context plays a prominent role in everyday perception. Contextual information can facilitate recognition of objects within scenes by providing predictions about objects that are most likely to appear in a specific setting, along with the locations that are most likely to contain objects in the scene. Is such identity-related (semantic) and location-related (spatial) contextual knowledge represented separately or jointly as a bound representation? We conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) priming experiment whereby semantic and spatial contextual relations between prime and target object pictures were independently manipulated. This method allowed us to determine whether the two contextual factors affect object recognition with or without interacting, supporting a unified versus independent representations, respectively. Results revealed a Semantic Spatial interaction in reaction times for target object recognition. Namely, significant semantic priming was obtained when targets were positioned in expected (congruent), but not in unexpected (incongruent), locations. fMRI results showed corresponding interactive effects in brain regions associated with semantic processing (inferior prefrontal cortex), visual contextual processing (parahippocampal cortex), and object-related processing (lateral occipital complex). In addition, activation in fronto-parietal areas suggests that attention and memory-related processes might also contribute to the contextual effects observed. These findings indicate that object recognition benefits from associative representations that integrate information about objects' identities and their locations, and directly modulate activation in object-processing cortical regions. Such context frames are useful in maintaining a coherent and meaningful representation of the visual world, and in providing a platform from which predictions can be generated to facilitate perception and action.","['Nurit Gronau', 'Maital Neta', 'Moshe Bar']",69,['57314455-27b8-456c-b810-571ec13f899a'],Integrated contextual representation for objects' identities and their locations,Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience,2008,4adf0be7-eb66-41e5-ad94-01950e4a815a
"This paper focuses on the query processing module of RIME, an experimental prototype of an intelligent information retrieval system designed to manage high-precision queries on a corpus of medical reports. Though highly specific this particular corpus is representative of an important class of applications: information retrieval among full-text specialized documents which constitute critical sources of information in several organizations (medicine, law, space industry…). This experience allowed us to design and implement an elaborate model for the semantic content of the documents which is an extension of the Conceptual Dependency approach. The underlying retrieval model is inspired from the Logic model proposed by C.J. Van Rijsbergen, which has been considerably refined using an Extended Modal Logic. After presenting the context of the RIME project, we briefly describe the models designed for the internal representation of medical reports and queries. The main part of the paper is then devoted to the retrieval model and its application to the query processing module of RIME which has a natural language interface. Processing a query involves two main phases: the interpretation which transforms the natural language query into a search expression, and the evaluation phases which retrieves the corresponding medical reports. We focus here on the evaluation phases and show its relationship with the underlying retrieval model. Evaluations from practical experiments are also given, along with indications about current developments of the project.","['Yves Chiaramella', 'Jian-Yun Nie']",50,"['0a7d5c77-1cbe-4abe-afa7-e3eab7f716aa', '2764c154-896d-4d3f-87ee-f5904b659bd1', 'e75d8e62-a86d-4241-953f-1b315005d920']",A retrieval model based on an extended modal logic and its application to the RIME experimental approach,international acm sigir conference on research and development in information retrieval,1989,4adf1839-e92f-48e6-866d-b03868bc9db1

"Our paper proposes an approach for the extraction of stream channels from Airborne Laser Swath Mapping (ALSM) data. Recent advances in technology have led to high-resolution topographic data acquisition by means of airborne lidar (i.e. ALSM), which can yield Digital Elevation Model (DEM) datasets with horizontal resolutions of 1 m and vertical rms errors in the range of 10 - 15 cm. The extraction of a stream network from a DEM plays a fundamental role in modeling spatially distributed hydrological processes and flow routing. We apply morphological filtering to an ALSM DEM to detect and characterize stream channels in forested terrain. Since the size and shape of morphological Structuring Elements (SEs) is known to strongly affect filtered results, we test for accuracy by developing a set of error measures over simulated terrain. We subsequently apply the filter to actual ALSM data. For linking disconnected stream segments, a measure of pixel connectedness known as the Connectivity Number is used. The method presented is shown to enable systematic characterization and comparisons of streams, even in heavily forested terrain.","['Hyun-chong Cho', 'Kittipat Kampa', 'K.C.

"With the size and increasing complexity of telecom networks, there is a need to interconnect management systems at different levels. This requires information flow across many applications in a domain independent way. XML is a widely deployed standard which is being used for integration of network management system(NMS) with other applications. We examine the performance of different transport mechanisms, JMS, CORBA, HTTP and RMI for an XML message based event Notification Service. To improve the performance of XML message based event notifications, event grouping is examined and is found to perform well.","['Ravinder Thirumala', 'N. Usha Rani', 'Timothy A.

"The quality of video is ultimately judged by human eye; however, mean squared error and the like that have been used as quality metrics are poorly correlated with human perception. Although the characteristics of human visual system have been incorporated into perceptual-based rate control, most existing schemes do not take rate-distortion optimization into consideration. In this paper, we use the structural similarity index as the quality metric for rate-distortion modeling and develop an optimum bit allocation and rate control scheme for video coding. This scheme achieves up to 25% bit-rate reduction over the JM reference software of H.264. Under the rate-distortion optimization framework, the proposed scheme can be easily integrated with the perceptual-based mode decision scheme. The overall bit-rate reduction may reach as high as 32% over the JM reference software.","['Tao-Sheng Ou', 'Yi-Hsin Huang', 'Homer H.

"To improve compensation to channel or interference changes, we propose adapting an auxiliary feedback filter (FBF) in the receiver of systems which use Tomlinson-Harashima (1971, 1972) precoding. We show how the auxiliary FBF can be adapted in conjunction with the receiver feedforward filter (FFF). Simulations demonstrate the performance advantage of our auxiliary FBF technique relative to FFF updating alone, and how the FFF combines interference suppression with despreading in wideband applications. Error propagation can be effectively avoided by using the auxiliary FBF values to decide when to update the precoder, while transient increases in mean-squared error are avoided by using the FBF values in the update equation.","['John E.

"Market-based mechanisms can be used to coordinate self-interested multi-robot systems in fully distributed environments, where by self-interested we mean that each robot agent attempts to maximize a payoff function that accounts for both the resources consumed and the contribution made by the robot. In previous work, we have studied the effect of various market rules and bidding strategies on the global performance of the multi-robot system. However, rather than use a central monitoring and enforcement mechanisms, we rely on agents to self-report their actions. This assumes that the agents act honestly. In this paper, we drop the honesty assumption, raising the possibility that agents may exaggerate their contribution in order to increase their payoff. To address the problem of such malicious behavior, we propose an audit mechanism to maintain the integrity of reported payoffs. Our algorithm extends previous work on preventing free-riding in peer-to-peer networks. Specifically, we consider locality and mobility in multi-robot systems. We show that our approach efficiently detects malicious behaviors with a high probability.","['MyungJoo Ham', 'Gul Agha']",3,"['0b91faa3-a7d1-45b3-aac8-ef15351cc765', '3ca690a8-b22c-4a3a-8928-73afbf189489', '3fb8f085-3ea6-4102-b0ca-efb720418bc7', '801484ee-8bc9-4b19-bcbc-0a8c10c35ee0', 'b1575d1c-ef81-4cb3-b707-5070f109557d', 'dfef3fae-06ac-4f3c-9b9d-8f605ad14c49', 'e5f77a1b-3064-49a6-885f-0951b552cd07', 'e7a5943b-727c-4512-a839-6ef2b1b0e4e2']",A Robust Audit Mechanism to Prevent Malicious Behaviors in Multi-robot Systems,self-adaptive and self-organizing systems,2008,4ae00afd-f4fe-4829-91bc-4c0681a987bd

The latter displays video content concurrently manipulated using the feedback of the user?s emotional state. The results of effectiveness of the system indicated that the response time of the emotional content communication system was nearly instant, the changes of between emotional contents and emotional states base on physiological signals was corresponded. The user?s concentration was increased by watching the measuredemotion- based rendered visual stimuli.

A new method for the detection of motion and the computation of optical flow is presented. In the first step of the calculation the intensity history at each pixel is convolved with the second derivative in time of a temporal Gaussian smoothing function. The zero crossings in a single frame of the resulting function indicate the positions of moving edges. Spatial and temporal derivatives of the function at the zero-crossing locations are then used to compute the component of the flow that is normal to the zero-crossing contours. Both the detection of motion and the computation of the normal velocity are insensitive to slow temporal and spatial changes in the image intensity that are caused by illumination effects rather than motion. A framework in which to relate the present work to a number of gradient based flow measurement techniques is also presented.,"['James H.

"In this paper, we present an extension of the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm that simultaneously registers multiple 3D scans. While ICP fails to utilize the multiview constraints available, our method exploits the information redundancy in a set of 3D scans by using the averaging of relative motions. This averaging method utilizes the Lie group structure of motions, resulting in a 3D registration method that is both efficient and accurate. In addition, we present two variants of our approach, i.e., a method that solves for multiview 3D registration while obeying causality and a transitive correspondence variant that efficiently solves the correspondence problem across multiple scans. We present experimental results to characterize our method and explain its behavior as well as those of some other multiview registration methods in the literature. We establish the superior accuracy of our method in comparison to these multiview methods with registration results on a set of well-known real datasets of 3D scans.","['Venu Madhav Govindu', 'A.

"OBJECTIVE: The objective was to study the performance of a manual tracking task with system flexibility and time delays in the input channel and to examine the effects of input shaping the human operator's commands. BACKGROUND: It has long been known that low-frequency, lightly damped vibration hinders performance of a manually controlled system. Recently, input shaping has been shown to improve the performance of such systems in a compensatory-display tracking task. It is unknown if similar improvements are seen with pursuit-display tasks, or how the improvement changes when time delays are added to the system. METHOD: A total of 18 novice participants performed a pursuit-view tracking experiment with a spring-centered joystick. Controlled elements included an integrator, an integrator with a lightly damped flexible mode, and an input-shaped integrator with a flexible mode. The input to these controlled elements was delayed between 0 and 1 s. Tracking performance was quantified by root mean square tracking error, and subjective difficulty was quantified by ratings on a Cooper-Harper scale. RESULTS: Performance was best with the undelayed integrator. Both time delay and flexibility degraded performance. Input shaping improved control of the flexible element, with a diminishing benefit as the time delay increased. Tracking error and subjective rating were significantly related. Some operators used a pulsive control strategy. CONCLUSION: Input shaping can improve the performance of a manually controlled system with flexibility, even when time delays are present. APPLICATION: This study is useful to designers of human-controlled systems, especially those with problematic flexibility and/or time delays.

The database enables users to search for drugs with a visual display of known interactions with phase I (Cytochrome P450) and phase II enzymes, transporters, food and herbs. For each interaction, PubMed references are given. To detect mutual impairments of drugs, the drug-cocktail tool displays interactions between selected drugs. By choosing the indication for a drug, the tool offers suggestions for alternative medications to avoid metabolic conflicts. Drug interactions can also be visualized in an interactive network view.

"In this paper, we introduce the idea of using motion estimation resources from a video codec for video denoising. This is not straightforward because the motion estimators aimed for video compression and coding, tolerate errors in the estimated motion field and hence are not directly applicable to video denoising. To solve this problem, we propose a novel motion field filtering step that refines the accuracy of the motion estimates to a degree that is required for denoising. We illustrate the use of the proposed motion estimation method within a wavelet-based video denoising scheme. The resulting video denoising method is of low-complexity and receives comparable results with respect to the latest video denoising methods.","['Ljubomir Jovanov', 'Aleksandra Pizurica', 'Vladimir Zlokolica', 'Stefan Schulte', 'Etienne E.

"Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) encode, as event sequences, potentially unbounded ways to interact with software. During testing it becomes necessary to effectively sample the GUI’s event space. Ideally, for increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of GUI testing, one would like to sample the GUI’s event space by only generating sequences that (1) are allowed by the GUI’s structure, and (2) chain together only those events that have data dependencies between their event handlers. We propose a new model, called an eventdependency graph (EDG) of the GUI that captures data dependencies between the code of event handlers. We develop a mapping between an EDG and an existing black-box model of the GUI’s structure, called an event-flow graph (EFG). We automate the EDG construction in a tool that analyzes the bytecode of each event handler. We evaluate our“grey-box”approach using four open-source applications and compare it with the EFG approach.

"There is a need for frameless guidance systems to help surgeons plan the exact location for incisions, to define the margins of tumors, and to precisely identify locations of neighboring critical structures. The authors have developed an automatic technique for registering clinical data, such as segmented magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) reconstructions, with any view of the patient on the operating table. The authors demonstrate on the specific example of neurosurgery. The method enables a visual mix of live video of the patient and the segmented three-dimensional (3-D) MRI or CT model. This supports enhanced reality techniques for planning and guiding neurosurgical procedures and allows us to interactively view extracranial or intracranial structures nonintrusively. Extensions of the method include image guided biopsies, focused therapeutic procedures, and clinical studies involving change detection over time sequences of images.","['W.E.L. Grimson', 'Gil J.

"A method for finding the fastest possible gradient waveforms for any given k-space trajectory is presented. It is an extension of our previously introduced solution. The original scheme provides an efficient and non-iterative method for designing the fastest freely rotatable gradient waveforms. Here, the hardware constraints are relaxed so that each axis is constrained independently. This produces the fastest possible non-rotatable waveforms that can be up to 10% faster than their previous counterparts. In addition, for circular trajectories we relax the path constraints. This results in new diamond-shaped trajectories, which are more optimized than circles for separable gradient sets, reducing the total travel time by up to an additional 11%. Analysis of performance for a variety of parameters including the sensitivity to field inhomogeneity compared to freely rotatable circle trajectories is presented.","['Sara Vaziri', 'Michael Lustig']",6,"['058faab2-4fd3-47af-837f-1cc6cbedbca6', '9dd8c19d-db5c-41af-bbf9-8f0e1255071a', 'ea943716-fe7f-4654-9fce-bbe07968d442']",The fastest gradient waveforms for arbitrary and optimized k-space trajectories,international symposium on biomedical imaging,2013,4ae0dbe0-b2ce-46e7-97cb-090c8d39b9a3
"In social pharmacy and pharmacoepidemiology the distribution, use and performance of medication after registration is studied. In both fields, the pharmacists are the main source of data on drug use. To increase the value of research, we think it important to exchange ideas and suggestions between scientific researchers and pharmacists who work in community pharmacies. Hence, the department of Social Pharmacy and Pharmacoepidemiology of the University of Groningen sought close collaboration with some community pharmacies in the region, resulting in the InterAction project. The pharmacists deliver data to the InterAction database and are explicitly invited to raise questions and issues from their practice, and to participate in research. Consequently, science and practice benefit from each other's input and expertise. This paper describes the architecture and contents of the InterAction project. Additionally, the first experiences with the database as a laboratory for social pharmacy and pharmacoepidemiology are discussed.","['Hilde Tobi', 'Paul B. van den Berg', 'Lolkje T.

"Social media have attracted considerable attention because their open-ended nature allows users to create lightweight semantic scaffolding to organize and share content. To date, the interplay of the social and topical components of social media has been only partially explored. Here, we study the presence of homophily in three systems that combine tagging social media with online social networks. We find a substantial level of topical similarity among users who are close to each other in the social network. We introduce a null model that preserves user activity while removing local correlations, allowing us to disentangle the actual local similarity between users from statistical effects due to the assortative mixing of user activity and centrality in the social network. This analysis suggests that users with similar interests are more likely to be friends, and therefore topical similarity measures among users based solely on their annotation metadata should be predictive of social links. We test this hypothesis on several datasets, confirming that social networks constructed from topical similarity capture actual friendship accurately. When combined with topological features, topical similarity achieves a link prediction accuracy of about 92p.","['Luca Maria Aiello', 'Alain Barrat', 'Rossano Schifanella', 'Ciro Cattuto', 'Benjamin Markines', 'Filippo Menczer']",150,"['01cd69ee-9646-451c-9a64-68c94c63f5bb', '039e5d9a-37f3-4e8a-a5e9-1e2c7406dbb8', '0ad2acb7-43ee-424d-b4d2-472e167a9c84', '14456164-804d-4a4c-a2c2-ca6f9e8ee2fa', '1553c170-1de4-4e06-8309-031138d1af14', '17cd4498-d13d-4b01-b53a-8268f65448f4', '17fbbb03-8b91-4ea6-af29-9fc8fd1f4364', '1a4b7dd6-c11f-4fd1-9454-aeb6f3420d2a', '1e47880b-ff54-4110-a9c2-de0af73dbec7', '27fb0855-ef76-4238-b97b-d44435cc1095', '3315a1dd-9426-4e38-a34f-6aa92c61df57', '33d6dabd-c086-4a6e-939a-c322b6ada724', '3b9ffcd7-e80f-420a-9e6b-e73b9459110f', '404f2245-9ef6-4072-a0ad-44e64ce4e761', '40d9a6c9-b99e-43cc-90eb-5259cf4416a0', '49ffeead-ce7c-4a00-aae5-94aace89c38c', '5f5f1d00-4b9a-483b-b54a-ae746885401b', '67e5fb47-ee94-4a24-97ef-30e47bb117ef', '69f988d0-f5e7-455f-a9fc-ee9d9a1c97ce', '6f22a32a-8143-4846-b989-8d7de3fe829f', '6f22bbf0-d552-4c1a-8378-9e44e8d213d8', '768d90c6-5db7-4d04-b0a5-7cf4025f61c4', '8026f56a-a93e-4933-8ead-c9aa9e3f0498', '887b20f6-18a3-4803-8d92-3b4827458be2', '892d5d27-8e30-4ab2-b157-3eb1639e2a1d', '9083c861-cdc9-4100-9556-9b33e0b4e2f3', '9dbdc129-b8f3-4712-9c95-406bc8911bee', '9f187dd6-4aa7-4823-b461-0971952f8aa7', '9f4379ac-fe82-494f-a763-407c39b84d9d', 'b0343ad7-18dc-4b01-bf1d-e64da8953ae6', 'b288f448-d2b8-493f-8eb4-fdede31c388d', 'b92f5495-64f2-4712-80ae-ceaf751618d0', 'bc528cd7-9227-4f47-92e4-fbeaff298049', 'c000f664-8505-4bdd-bab9-2a1ef52e52a7', 'cedeec09-9378-42b0-807f-d1425b1775b3', 'd5091d56-33a2-4a7a-aef9-ded7ad5d3e19', 'd928384d-50ee-4617-95f6-3be0b24c65a7', 'dac25988-9b63-4867-a283-746e220753d6', 'db61140b-0b1d-45a4-ac9f-9408444de7a7', 'eacc1f90-af1d-41ed-8cca-14f20ba173d1']",Friendship prediction and homophily in social media,ACM Transactions on The Web,2012,4ae14413-ccee-4312-9be9-4f9ca9416b6b

"This paper presents an approach of logic mapping into LUT-Array-Based PLD where Boolean functions in the form of the sum of generalized complex terms (SGCTs) can be mapped directly. While previous mapping approach requires predetermined variable ordering, our approach performs mapping and variable reordering simultaneously. For the purpose, we propose a directed acyclic graph based on the multiple valued decision diagram (MDD) and an algorithm to construct the graph. Our algorithm generates candidates of SGCT expressions for each node in a bottom-up manner and selects the variables in the current level by evaluating the sizes of SGCT expressions directly.

"In sequential logic circuits the transient errors that occur in a particular time frame will propagate to consecutive time frames thereby making the device more vulnerable. In this work we propose a probabilistic error model for sequential logic that can measure the expected output error probability, given a probabilistic input space, that account for both spatial dependencies and temporal correlations across the logic, using a time evolving causal network. We demonstrate our error model using MCNC and ISCAS benchmark circuits and validate it with HSpice simulations. Our observations show that, significantly low individual gate error probabilities produce at least 5 fold higher output error probabilities. The average error percentage of our results with reference to HSpice simulation results is only 4.43%.

"In the age of highly integrated system LSIs, design methodologies for shorter time-to-market and higher re-programmability after the chip fabrications are now key research issues because of the difficulty of complete verification before tape-out of LSI designs. In this paper, we first introduce an IP-based VLSI architecture that consists of a main processor and an additional hardware (both custom hard macros and FPGA on a single chip) specialized to be in charge of the specific instructions. We further replace the controller circuits of the specialized hardware with compact micro-controllers and memories by using IP libraries (hard macros), which results in the increase of the debuggability and the flexibility of design even for computations realized by hard macros. We call the proposed architecture as field modifiable architecture (FMA).

"We present a novel approach to modelling the non-linear and time- varying dynamics of human motion, using statistical methods to capture the char- acteristic motion patterns that exist in typical human activities. Our method is based on automatically clustering the body pose space into connected regions ex- hibiting similar dynamical characteristics, modelling the dynamics in each region as a Gaussian autoregressive process. Activities that would require large numbers of exemplars in example based methods are covered by comparatively few motion models. Different regions correspond roughly to different action-fragments and our class inference scheme allows for smooth transitions between these, thus mak- ing it useful for activity recognition tasks. The method is used to track activities including walking, running, etc., using a planar 2D body model. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by its success in tracking complicated motions like turns, without any key frames or 3D information.","['Ankur Agarwal', 'Bill Triggs']",121,"['09a4efee-bef3-4493-9280-a35fbfed8250', '0ac31fb9-39d6-432b-884a-ed1b0329ea74', '0e6e2394-e7bb-4610-9f18-23e0cbc1a3ae', '3336bec8-9d96-4615-8a5a-d23b61b57ed2', '33e4f444-6959-43f5-b42d-23851e057136', '37d86d82-dd18-4dff-98a3-aa2fdc9c32df', '4adf54c9-f808-4988-ad8a-bf9cc87c6668', '733eea21-9c61-4935-8ffd-5b8e56dd947d', '75c6e7ad-f17c-40e1-8c39-965534096b2b', '779db54d-a398-4ba9-aacf-7fd6cf976dcb', '7f3d9495-7b9e-44ad-a36b-61b8bd7e0e43', '8e4a459f-61ea-4355-803f-842f903c995b', '8e7aa72d-7e8d-4249-a099-10ea371d6af3', '9e782ace-7971-4a8b-bed8-6d01fbbb88e1', 'b5e72744-0105-48bf-95ea-753f52280f48', 'e1f50832-764f-4f22-b3b8-e2dec38c0413', 'f834c951-1be3-4e4f-80f9-3175e1323e7d', 'f9f23d02-d017-4a1d-b2f4-5268836ed426']",Tracking Articulated Motion using a Mixture of Autoregressive Models,european conference on computer vision,2004,4ae1cd06-a8b8-4692-b453-1662e1e62f08
Tree-structured knowledge representations are increasingly being used since the relationships between data objects can be represented in a more meaningful way. A number of tree mining algorithms were developed for mining different subtree types using different parameters. At this point in research it would be useful to discuss what kind of sub-problems can be solved within the current tree mining framework. In this paper we provide a general overview of the development in the area of tree mining and discuss motivations and useful application areas for each development. Implications of using different tree mining parameters and constraints are discussed. Such an overview will be particularly useful for those not so familiar with the area of tree mining as it can reveal useful applications within their domain of interest. It gives guidance as to which type of tree mining will be most useful for their particular application.,"['Fedja Hadzic', 'Tharam S.

"In this work we analyze the complexity of local broadcasting in the physical interference model. We present two distributed randomized algorithms: one that assumes that each node knows how many nodes there are in its geographical proximity, and another, which makes no assumptions about topology knowledge. We show that, if the transmission probability of each node meets certain characteristics, the analysis can be decoupled from the global nature of the physical interference model, and each node performs a successful local broadcast in time proportional to the number of neighbors in its physical proximity. We also provide worst-case optimality guarantees for both algorithms and demonstrate their behavior in average scenarios through simulations.","['Olga Goussevskaia', 'Thomas Moscibroda', 'Roger Wattenhofer']",93,"['00b195ea-90f4-4762-83b9-dc337772bd60', '09a5d9b5-786f-49c3-8df1-262a524a3cc0', '0cd62c6b-181e-45bc-96c4-01c9dcd4846a', '19581d69-1068-4279-b339-eeaacd277008', '1aa44b28-e931-466a-a929-adf8137b704f', '1baf90c8-5c75-4e5d-99f1-378571ef5a71', '23e0f8ec-c7b8-4704-b3f6-c50d6da10cd8', '277cd65c-dcb3-4347-835b-e058f2e057f1', '30885666-93e1-41b1-aaf4-a90f81118ca2', '321a3269-e8be-4069-9371-0fa33e30d360', '48467e74-1b97-42ef-8ca7-2d8fb6af8616', '5359a51b-a34a-4027-8a15-7aa83929abe5', '6858fa05-89cf-48b9-ab78-507b868de4bd', '69b00d47-d4b7-46c3-86c3-d944315ee27a', '7cce8d88-c3c4-46ed-95df-f0577f874db5', '866315bc-5c32-4f35-aa94-1954a9617add', '8cc9ea80-563f-4e62-bda9-8ff6d71cf6ae', 'a5ffacf4-2e2a-41f7-8f8c-cd4e11d821df', 'ba881adb-cb42-47ac-bf18-f197fe139505', 'bee4f656-10d8-4de2-9ee1-19ad4b8ef043', 'bfe1a3be-3ab8-491b-a515-de664bed8669', 'c4d536e4-1d49-4ec3-ba8f-b1416e873396', 'd85b1bb6-0337-4f79-a067-cef9eb08ea46', 'f34a7678-1f54-44db-b1e0-67bbf934fb6a', 'f833b903-da8a-4e2a-8103-1373013ab926', 'fba8e272-27e4-48bf-8b11-2565f6ff49da']",Local broadcasting in the physical interference model,,2008,4ae1e7f9-4c06-410a-8e52-514942e5d4a1
"In a worldwide environment, sustaining high yield with a minimum number of quality controls is key for manufacturing plants to remain competitive. In high-mix semiconductor plants, where more than 200 products are concurrently run, the complexity of designing efficient control plans comes from the larger amount of data and number of production parameters to handle. Several sampling algorithms were proposed in the literature, but most of them are seen impracticable when coming to an industrial implementation. In this paper, we present and discuss the industrial implementation of a dynamic sampling algorithm in a high-mix semiconductor plant. We describe how the sampling algorithm has been modified, and point out the set of questions that have been raised by the industrial program. Results indicate that more than 30% of control operations on lots could be avoided without increasing the material at risk in production.","['Justin Nduhura Munga', 'Stéphane Dauzère-Pérès', 'Philippe Vialletelle', 'Claude Yugma']",6,"['4d2f27b9-d6ce-468a-bf6e-261c564bc259', '6f5f3ded-90f5-40b7-ac80-bd96b0b57394', 'e5d320f3-d6bf-47a6-8711-cb8da3d21ddf']",Industrial implementation of a dynamic sampling algorithm in semiconductor manufacturing: approach and challenges,winter simulation conference,2012,4ae1eea9-0538-435f-9a63-c3fbccc0fde7
"This chapter reviews methods for the assessment and comparison of Pareto set approximations. Existing set quality measures from the literature are critically evaluated based on a number of orthogonal criteria, including invariance to scaling, monotonicity and computational effort. Statistical aspects of quality assessment are also considered in the chapter. Three main methods for the statistical treatment of Pareto set approximations deriving from stochastic generating methods are reviewed. The  dominance ranking method  is a generalization to partially-ordered sets of a standard non-parametric statistical test, allowing collections of Pareto set approximations from two or more stochastic optimizers to be directly compared statistically. The  quality indicator method  -- the dominant method in the literature -- maps each Pareto set approximation to a number, and performs statistics on the resulting distribution(s) of numbers. The  attainment function method  estimates the probability of attaining each goal in the objective space, and looks for significant differences between these probability density functions for different optimizers. All three methods are valid approaches to quality assessment, but give different information. We explain the scope and drawbacks of each approach and also consider some more advanced topics, including multiple testing issues, and using combinations of indicators. The chapter should be of interest to anyone concerned with generating and analysing Pareto set approximations.","['Eckart Zitzler', 'Joshua D.

"This paper is motivated by multichannel sampling applications. We consider a hybrid filter banks consisting of a set of fractional delays operators, slow A/D converters with different antialiasing filters, digital expanders, and digital synthesis filters (to be designed). The synthesis filters are designed to minimize the maximum gain of a hybrid induced error system. We show that the induced error system is equivalent to a digital system. This digital system enables the design of stable synthesis filters using existing control theory tools such as model-matching and linear matrix inequalities. Moreover, the induced error is robust against delay estimate errors. Numerical experiments show the proposed approach yields better performance compared to existing techniques.","['Ha T.

"Today’s development processes employ a variety of notations and tools, e.g., the Unified Modeling Language UML, the Standard Description Language SDL, requirements databases, design tools, code generators, model checkers, etc. For better process support, the employed tools may be organized within a tool suite or integration platform, e.g., Rational Rose or Eclipse. While these tool-integration platforms usually provide GUI adaption mechanisms and functional adaption via application programming interfaces, they frequently do not provide appropriate means for data integration at the meta-model level. Thus, overlapping and redundant data from different “integrated” tools may easily become inconsistent and unusable. We propose two design patterns that provide a flexible basis for the integration of different tool data at the meta-model level. To achieve consistency between meta-models, we describe rule-based mechanisms providing generic solutions for managing overlapping and redundant data. The proposed mechanisms are widely used within the Fujaba Tool Suite.

"We present a new algorithm for simultaneous filtering and parameter estimation of chaotic time series corrupted by additive measurement noise. This method is based on iteratively minimizing the total least squares (TLS) error in the phase-space using steepest descent. In contrast to prior work, we assume that the dynamic equations modeling the nonlinear time series are known, but the corresponding parameters are not. Specifically, the data is assumed to be generated from time series satisfying a set of coupled logistics equations corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise. This work is motivated in part by language modeling, where the dynamics of a conversation are argued to satisfy the coupled logistics equations and the time series data represents noisy measurements taken from protocols. Accurate estimation of the process parameters is critical, e.g., in diagnosing and treating different types of language disorders and also may prove valuable for testing and improving language understanding systems.","['Susan M.

Though they are functionally similar to electrorheological (ER) fluids, MR fluids exhibit much higher yield strengths for the applied magnetic fields than ER fluids for the applied electric fields. The devices using MR fluids have an ability to provide high-torque, low-inertia, a safe device and simple interface. In this study, we report on an actuator developed using the MR fluid, which consists of an input part, an output part and an MR fluid clutch between them. First, the basic experiments are examined to investigate the characteristics of the actuator. Next, the torque control system of the MR-fluid actuator is proposed. Finally, the closed-loop control experiments were carried out and it is confirmed that the torque-feedback control is effective for improving the response properties of MR actuators.","['Naoyuki Takesue', 'Junji Furusho', 'Masamichi Sakaguchi']",22,['8082a4fe-4c12-4ae0-8cfb-40c4a94f4c81'],Improvement of response properties of MR-fluid actuator by torque feedback control,international conference on robotics and automation,2001,4ae27281-aede-499c-9ff3-56f50fff82b2
"Providing multiple modes to support dynamically changing environments, standards, and new services is prevalent in embedded systems, especially in mobile radio systems. Because such a system frequently contains time-constrained tasks, it is important to analyze the temporal requirements as well as the functional correctness. This paper presents a method to analyze temporal requirements imposed on an embedded real-time system supporting multiple modes. While most performance analysis methods focus only on testing the feasibility of a task or a system, our method goes further by addressing the problem of locating hot spots of a system thereby helping the designer to choose among alternative designs or architectures. We formally define the analysis problem and show that it is very unlikely to be solved efficiently. We present a heuristic algorithm, which is accurate and fast enough to be used in iterative processes in system-level analysis and design. The analysis problem is extended to accommodate probabilistic behavior exhibited by soft real-time tasks.","['Youngsoo Shin', 'Dae-Hong Kim', 'Kiyoung Choi']",50,"['1a06f6ad-f4b9-450e-bc81-aa5d8956ae21', '3805844b-8ebb-42d9-8607-0c827583854d', '41b1aa6f-0cdf-475c-b786-fb30b675caa0', '5e8b52b0-5676-443a-9ef7-6fd753406246', '77dcce9f-5c6d-44bc-a8f3-abea83b26826', '81f76a83-edcb-415a-98f2-5c764e1012b3', '834d24a4-87cf-417d-a78f-2390494d6f51', '8a7848ce-2a13-40a6-b801-b21e8e1ca2e8', '8d696752-b062-4310-ba80-1fb8d6faa0fa', 'ac0add47-3271-4edd-9c98-6fbfb9d46e55', 'ae97a9ac-4442-4d04-93e0-9fa367f71386', 'c43a8564-cb7f-45e8-9ccd-9bfda2c991c5', 'd7eb74d3-04a3-476b-8e3d-563f6729ca3b', 'ec70c332-ec64-4d07-bc89-488594f8166b']",Schedulability-driven performance analysis of multiple mode embedded real-time systems,design automation conference,2000,4ae28117-19d8-4425-9c76-21e73ddc231c

The performance of maximal ratio combining (MRC) diversity is analyzed in the presence of multiple equal-power cochannel interferers and additive white Gaussian noise. Closed-form expressions are derived for the average probability of error as well as outage probability of both coherent and noncoherent (differentially coherent) binary frequency-shift keying and binary phase-shift keying schemes in an environment with cochannel interference and noise. The results are expressed in terms of the confluent hypergeometric function of the second kind, a function that can be easily evaluated numerically.

"Abstract separation logics are a family of extensions of Hoare logic for reasoning about programs that mutate memory. These logics are ""abstract"" because they are independent of any particular concrete memory model. Their assertion languages, called propositional abstract separation logics, extend the logic of (Boolean) Bunched Implications (BBI) in various ways.   We develop a modular proof theory for various propositional abstract separation logics using cut-free labelled sequent calculi. We first extend the cut-fee labelled sequent calculus for BBI of Hou et al to handle Calcagno et al's original logic of separation algebras by adding sound rules for partial-determinism and cancellativity, while preserving cut-elimination. We prove the completeness of our calculus via a sound intermediate calculus that enables us to construct counter-models from the failure to find a proof. We then capture other propositional abstract separation logics by adding sound rules for indivisible unit and disjointness, while maintaining completeness and cut-elimination. We present a theorem prover based on our labelled calculus for these logics.","['Zhe Hou', 'Ranald Clouston', 'Rajeev Goré', 'Alwen Tiu']",17,"['03141375-fc8f-4c36-b0c6-a15e19eda5e4', '0cbdbc6b-c13a-4f1a-9511-10b8af5688d9', '13d0ca0c-de94-4a3f-a740-500b4234dfe2', '14e7f7f9-faa8-45d8-8e81-638abbd4e4ac', '2c7f00f1-02f7-47e0-874a-c8e1f4c1d638', '56845916-b548-46cd-b3c4-4db8c44c293b', '602a2b97-a181-434e-9565-04b29f07b021', '736157cb-067f-4169-bc16-ed0f20e1be8f', '7613e91d-0d12-45f4-a310-8848c1d23832', '76f8a047-39f0-4eab-8501-ce35b13723e7', '89b9f254-f6e6-4831-ae73-df9d339acd6e', '8c4ba77c-3fa3-4eb4-9318-3c2b37a90dbb', '8f690fb4-8494-4bbc-a895-6e086d389adf', '9091b5ac-84a1-4298-87c1-527f55b51a7b', '9bc5418e-84fd-4023-813a-3d6c29523cd4', '9f8150e4-2964-42da-856b-60cf8f3c7ed2', 'a1767dc9-eba3-4b8c-abc3-b648acfff62b', 'a1987524-3867-414a-b047-1d48dd4f2d37', 'a32dc9b4-3912-4e74-870f-a39f57d2b74e', 'a956447c-52d5-458e-ab6f-33b2e8976b1f', 'c57e5d3a-6951-4f10-8306-86e98d79d54a', 'ea5a42b4-89cc-432b-89d0-886ed099d146', 'ec19e132-0ee8-4fb1-b3ac-441728763e26', 'fa155a2a-1a06-4602-b2a5-7746ea7b4dd2']",Proof search for propositional abstract separation logics via labelled sequents,symposium on principles of programming languages,2014,4ae2e3d4-202d-4e5c-957a-668a86abf223
"Storyboarding is a common technique in HCI and design for demonstrating system interfaces and contexts of use. Despite its recognized benefits, novice designers still encounter challenges in the creation of storyboards. Furthermore, as computing becomes increasingly integrated into the environment, blurring the distinction between the system and its surrounding context, it is imperative to depict context explicitly in storyboards. In this paper, we present two formative studies designed to uncover the important elements of storyboards. These elements include the use of text, inclusion of people, level of detail, number of panels, and representation of the passage of time. We further present an empirical study to assess the effects of these elements on the understanding and enjoyment of storyboard consumers. Finally, we demonstrate how these guidelines were successfully used in an undergraduate HCI class.","['Khai N. Truong', 'Gillian R. Hayes', 'Gregory D.

"We focus on constraint-based automated addition of nonmasking and stabilizing fault-tolerance to hierarchical programs. We specify legitimate states of the program in terms of constraints that should be satisfied in those states. To deal with faults that may violate these constraints, we add recovery actions while ensuring interference freedom among the recovery actions added for satisfying different constraints. Since the constraint-based{\em manual} design of fault-tolerance is well-known to be applicable in the manual design of nonmasking fault-tolerance, we expect our approach to have a significant benefit in automation of fault-tolerant programs. We illustrate our algorithms with three case studies:stabilizing mutual exclusion, stabilizing diffusing computation, and a data dissemination problem in sensor networks. With experimental results,we show that the complexity of synthesis is reasonable and that it can be reduced using the {\em structure} of the hierarchical systems. To our knowledge, this is the first instance where automated synthesis has been successfully used in synthesizing programs that are correct under fairness assumptions. Moreover, in two of the case studies considered in this paper, the structure of the recovery paths is too complex to permit existing heuristic based approaches for adding recovery.","['Fuad Abujarad', 'Sandeep S.

"This paper presents new algorithms for conducting cooperative sensing using a mobile backbone network. This hierarchical sensing approach combines backbone nodes, which have superior mobility and communication capability, with regular nodes, which are constrained in mobility and communication capability but which can sense the environment. In the framework of a cooperative exploration problem, a technique is developed for simultaneous placement and assignment of regular and mobile backbone nodes. This method, a generalization of existing techniques that only consider stationary regular nodes, optimally solves the simultaneous placement and assignment problem in computationally tractable time for problems of moderate size. For large-scale instances of this problem, a polynomial-time approximation algorithm is developed. This algorithm carries the benefit of a theoretical performance guarantee and also performs well in practice.

"Quantitative market research and qualitative user-centered design research have long had an uneasy and complex relationship. A trend toward increasingly complex statistical segmentations and associated personas will once again increase the urgency of addressing paradigm differences to allow the two disciplines to collaborate effectively.   We present an instructive case in which qualitative field research helped contribute to abandoning a ""state of the art"" quantitative user segmentation that was used in an attempt to unify both marketing and user experience planning around a shared model of users. This case exposes risks in quantitative segmentation research, common fallacies in the evolving practice of segmentation and use of personas, and the dangers of excessive deference to quantitative research generally.",['David A.

"The long-term availability of data stored in a file system depends on how well it safeguards on-disk pointers used to access the data. Ideally, a system would correct all pointer errors. In this paper, we examine how well corruption-handling techniques work in reality. We develop a new technique called type-aware pointer corruption to systematically explore how a file system reacts to corrupt pointers. This approach reduces the exploration space for corruption experiments and works without source code. We use type-aware pointer corruption to examine Windows NTFS and Linux ext3. We find that they rely on type and sanity checks to detect corruption, and NTFS recovers using replication in some instances. However, NTFS and ext3 do not recover from most corruptions, including many scenarios for which they possess sufficient redundant information, leading to further corruption, crashes, and unmountable file systems. We use our study to identify important lessons for handling corrupt pointers.","['Lakshmi N. Bairavasundaram', 'Meenali Rungta', 'Nitin Agrawa', 'Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau', 'Remzi H.

"The video games industry is one of the fastest-growing industries in the world, bolstered by sophisticated technology in gaming consoles and modern trends such as mobile and social gaming. The goal of most video games is to entertain the gamer and in most games this stems from the interaction between the gamer and the non-player characters (NPCs): it is no longer sufficient for a game to be visually appealing but instead, the gamer must be challenged at the right level of difficulty to be engaged by the game. It is thus necessary to develop suitable NPCs that are fun to play against and the realm of computational intelligence offers a variety of techniques to do so. However, the perception of fun is clearly subjective and indeed, difficult to quantify. In this paper we make use of the Ms Pac-Man vs Ghosts gaming competition to gather and analyse data from human gamers regarding their preference of opponent: each gamer plays two games against different ghost teams, indicating their preference at the end. We subsequently use this data to establish which ghost teams are generally preferred and demonstrate that there are measurable differences between these ghost teams. These differences are sufficient to group the ghosts into different categories with a good degree of accuracy. This work is a first step in better understanding the attributes required by NPCs for players to be engaged.","['Wichit Sombat', 'Philipp Rohlfshagen', 'Simon M.

"We investigate the use of different machine learning methods in combination with feature selection techniques to explore human multimodal dialogue strategies and the use of those strategies for automated dialogue systems. We learn policies from data collected in a Wizard-of-Oz study where different human ‘wizards’ decide whether to ask a clarification request in a multimodal manner or else to use speech alone. We first describe the data collection, the coding scheme and annotated corpus, and the validation of the multimodal annotations. We then show that there is a uniform multimodal dialogue strategy across wizards, which is based on multiple features in the dialogue context. These are generic features, available at runtime, which can be implemented in dialogue systems. Our prediction models (for human wizard behaviour) achieve a weighted f-score of 88.6 per cent (which is a 25.6 per cent improvement over the majority baseline). We interpret and discuss the learned strategy. We conclude that human wizard behaviour is not optimal for automatic dialogue systems, and argue for the use of automatic optimization methods, such as Reinforcement Learning. Throughout the investigation we also discuss the issues arising from using small initial Wizard-of-Oz data sets, and we show that feature engineering is an essential step when learning dialogue strategies from such limited data.","['Verena Rieser', 'Oliver Lemon']",50,"['138b7b80-6583-43bb-bb16-9d4622fa9788', '20ab2f1f-8428-4756-bea7-48aaf731f8d4', '245b1bc5-5d96-49e5-959e-6c4337c9fa47', '2ec206bd-8574-4cc0-ae3b-1e66fee7333a', '2f30d418-5c3b-4eaa-bf74-5f130da48e19', '340c101a-7317-4ba9-b642-a91eb2e456a7', '4935259d-fca4-454d-9128-6dfed1c72357', '6fbf3095-2118-442c-aeb0-b3df09a2ed5f', '77a8642a-1204-4a35-af6f-44c589b8ce5b', '8358f789-9b40-41c9-a3df-51ddb63cb6aa', '885b99be-7a76-4415-9787-ff6d1cfd3d2e', '9587aa89-e10f-4f9b-bf23-9dd1f528ebc8', '9f4bc807-fbe0-4bb6-8115-5953430c8ec7', 'a37f0208-190c-4f40-ba27-9556194cb53c', 'c15101a3-5387-43e1-80d9-660b8e4c9cdd', 'c246e2d3-e94f-49e0-b1ce-a76e8b064ece', 'c318fc72-41d2-432c-9e04-d32997034949', 'c942fe5e-6d82-4e79-9060-ccc9aa1bfd70', 'd20df5c3-667b-42d4-a128-d5f0b649cc32', 'd8ddd4ae-16ab-4702-b4f5-65aff0e33533', 'e2f38b9b-6318-4f2b-8a22-dfc4acd59f26']",Learning human multimodal dialogue strategies,Natural Language Engineering,2010,4ae3d54c-ae37-4c9e-91b0-574cd9d304c6
"A new scheme based on multi-objective hierarchical genetic algorithm (MOHGA) is proposed to extract interpretable rule-based knowledge from data. The approach is derived from the use of multiple objective genetic algorithm (MOGA), where the genes of the chromosome are arranged into control genes and parameter genes. These genes are in a hierarchical form so that the control genes can manipulate the parameter genes in a more effective manner. The effectiveness of this chromosome formulation enables the fuzzy sets and rules to be optimally reduced. Some important concepts about the interpretability are introduced and the fitness function in the MOGA will consider both the accuracy and interpretability of the fuzzy model. In order to remove the redundancy of the rule base proactively, we further apply an interpretability-driven simplification method to newborn individuals. In our approach, we first apply the fuzzy clustering to generate an initial rule-based model. Then the multi-objective hierarchical genetic algorithm and the recursive least square method are used to obtain the optimized fuzzy models. The accuracy and the interpretability of fuzzy models derived by this approach are studied and presented in this paper. We compare our work with other methods reported in the literature on four examples: a synthetic nonlinear dynamic system, a nonlinear static system, the Lorenz system and the Mackey-Glass system. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is effective and practical in knowledge extraction.","['Hanli Wang', 'Sam Kwong', 'Yaochu Jin', 'Wei Wei', 'Kim-Fung Man']",198,"['073cece6-47b1-44ca-b10b-8daa504ae13b', '0cc8a4bb-8bb1-4526-ab1e-ae8ff4eccc6d', '36bbb4bc-8bde-4376-99a0-be199ee0f48e', '36e2290a-d302-487a-aac6-2fa8f3c8a1b1', '4525b1ee-9806-41d1-9a16-9d62b8bc5e19', '47bd74f3-2061-4d9a-9a30-def2c6276fb4', '480d3d53-1a50-46d9-8863-41592a08ab36', '511a2c29-bd6d-4993-b3d4-03da9b43a2b0', '7d61c267-468d-4a46-ae82-ee2097639e88', '95c48079-e3a3-45eb-8c1e-5a61f970d02d', '96c210e3-f75b-4e15-b3fa-c9ee755e4cc2', '9b80e173-2d0d-4e2d-8cd0-0fcfe230fd81', 'a1eb7703-602f-4a48-be83-37977a37cde5', 'a3ab763e-d66d-4551-a263-e91239003a1f', 'a6805395-ab4a-43e4-9d02-1c8e67661122', 'a7bdace3-4ab0-4fee-af6b-3aadebc9638c', 'aac56882-01e5-41ea-8ec9-883105b8468c', 'b2c2e089-f7f8-4b8e-98e7-51dd6e82e93e', 'd47dcf6c-1abb-4bc8-90d8-3972307f8722', 'd4d8c138-c14e-44d1-b309-ed5502fb19ac', 'dad9a8b7-e815-431c-87bf-e0c2bc596a76', 'e07c17af-995e-477a-9808-cb8ef7f8d7e1']",Multi-objective hierarchical genetic algorithm for interpretable fuzzy rule-based knowledge extraction,Fuzzy Sets and Systems,2005,4ae3e0e1-912d-4da2-a783-20b7a28b3e21
"Results from empirical research in Requirements Engineering lead us to characterise work processes, not as evolutionary and systematic, but as semi structured, emergent and creative. These same properties are found in Situated Action models where work is described as emergent and self defining. At another level within these processes, we use the term ""cognitive dust"" to describe the External and Distributed cognitive representations suspended in a small group workspace. These cognitive representations are components of communicative actions between humans, or between humans and their technological infrastructures, and are part of these creative processes. We use a multi modal sensor infrastructure, which is situated in a ubiquitous workspace, to observe and capture this cognitive dust. We hypothesise that, if an infrastructure can capture enough of these representations and extract enough semantic meaning to ""understand"" the communicative intentions, the infrastructure can dynamically support creative, unstructured activities. This paper sets out the conceptual, theoretical framework for this research by linking known CSCW theories with the emergent, unstructured or semi structured nature of creative work processes within small groups such as designers.","['Terence Blackburn', 'Paul A.

"We analyze different retransmission (ARQ) schemes for error control in multicast protocols geared toward real-time, multimedia applications. We discuss why retransmission schemes are not inappropriate for such applications, but in fact can be quite effective. We present a quantitative analysis of such schemes, as well as simulation results, taking into account four different parameters (and not just the source throughput): (1) the probability of dropping a packet due to limited time for retransmissions; (2) the average time required to deliver a packet correctly to end receivers; (3) the number of times a packet will be retransmitted; and (4) the cost to the network, in terms of packet duplications, of retransmitting a packet. We reach the counter-intuitive conclusion that the optimum scheme, in terms of all four of the above parameters, in the most general scenarios (where several hosts with widely varying propagation delays and 'quality of connections' are participating in the session) is to immediately retransmit packets-preferably multicast-upon reception of a NACK from any receiver. We also demonstrate, again through quantitative analysis, the circumstances under which it would be beneficial (as well as those under which it would be counter-productive) to multicast control messages in the hope of suppressing duplicates and preventing the source from being overwhelmed by control messages.","['Sassan Pejhan', 'Mischa Schwartz', 'Dimitris Anastassiou']",149,"['0695070f-320e-4d26-9c68-2c8faa20c944', '20836695-ca47-4494-b553-e9f3b3fb9aca', '33b1ab46-f4af-4204-a2c8-fbb3f9b67d12', '48e0629a-7bed-40bc-b749-07ab26646d4f', '48ff26df-3f32-43af-af22-2f241d67e480', '69739282-6946-4583-9506-8ca786054955', '90e6c852-a1c5-4023-a8be-11f214d729e4', '94da8bf6-ce27-4416-b2ae-238bc372c1c1', 'ee025190-5303-4b3e-84b2-a17c88382472', 'f6fc4443-7a98-4f9f-92e8-e4e5d94521a7', 'fd660eec-217c-4b8f-ae4f-3f14117e217d']",Error control using retransmission schemes in multicast transport protocols for real-time media,IEEE\/ACM Transactions on Networking,1996,4ae3f7cf-16ae-49eb-ac7a-348e013abddc
"Vectorization has been an important method of using data-level parallelism to accelerate scientific workloads on vector machines such as Cray for the past three decades. In the last decade it has also proven useful for accelerating multi-media and embedded applications on short SIMD architectures such as MMX, SSE and AltiVec. Most of the focus has been directed at innermost loops, effectively executing their iterations concurrently as much as possible. Outer loop vectorization refers to vectorizing a level of a loop nest other than the innermost, which can be beneficial if the outer loop exhibits greater data-level parallelism and locality than the innermost loop. Outer loop vectorization has traditionally been performed by interchanging an outer-loop with the innermost loop, followed by vectorizing it at the innermost position. A more direct unroll-and-jam approach can be used to vectorize an outer-loop without involving loop interchange, which can be especially suitable for short SIMD architectures.   In this paper we revisit the method of outer loop vectorization, paying special attention to properties of modern short SIMD architectures. We show that even though current optimizing compilers for such targets do not apply outer-loop vectorization in general, it can provide significant performance improvements over innermost loop vectorization. Our implementation of direct outer-loop vectorization, available in GCC 4.3, achieves speedup factors of 3.13 and 2.77 on average across a set of benchmarks, compared to 1.53 and 1.39 achieved by innermost loop vectorization, when running on a Cell BE SPU and PowerPC970 processors respectively. Moreover, outer-loop vectorization provides new reuse opportunities that can be vital for such short SIMD architectures, including efficient handling of alignment. We present an optimization tapping such opportunities, capable of further boosting the performance obtained by outer-loop vectorization to achieve average speedup factors of 5.26 and 3.64.","['Dorit Nuzman', 'Ayal Zaks']",54,"['05848b24-5693-4058-b5a7-9a579138d639', '0cbbc76f-96ab-4305-af8a-b7768b9ff9b5', '146a5e9b-7f51-4050-83d1-ef9ed80b3c02', '1e3bd4cd-8fb4-4092-a8a6-f6af17b678e8', '1f76567c-49ca-44bb-8e32-9a51be921e73', '34beb77d-c2c1-40e6-9ffb-600c2854304b', '4194ad70-c108-4139-b83b-82f43ff9225a', '606d2b62-968b-42b4-90cb-c5e025a9ed02', '69e79c27-812d-40b1-a556-94a2c4cd9b5d', '72c46e79-7da4-4e07-b080-449d21d47ed5', '85fa35f5-b583-44b5-a870-b122f2335258', '8b08a9fa-79fe-4e1d-869a-b34857d4392b', '8d0fda63-608f-4360-83d7-3b510de81baf', '99ef9751-1dd9-4f2a-8bdd-a4e411e71bc2', 'a1733516-e641-4360-9a80-1988e73e14ac', 'baa9f82c-7a29-49ce-a44b-4e09d94df936', 'cdd729d4-519d-46c3-a52a-c75d39730872', 'deb25f2f-784a-4195-9c0d-64f659433f56', 'df962348-0ded-40aa-8fc9-e6d33c5383c8', 'e177c91b-bde0-4ab8-9b8b-7fc52708880f', 'e501b500-8e2d-40ae-bda8-abab871e107a', 'f5b0ed81-df42-40dc-8768-5eecb2e643fe']",Outer-loop vectorization: revisited for short SIMD architectures,international conference on parallel architectures and compilation techniques,2008,4ae414a4-c0b3-4592-995d-1b47ca0410af

"Heart murmurs are pathological sounds produced by turbulent blood flow due to certain cardiac defects such as valves disorders. Detection of murmurs via auscultation is a task that depends on the proficiency of physician. There are many cases in which the accuracy of detection is questionable. The purpose of this study is development of a new mathematical model of systolic murmurs to extract their crucial features for identifying the heart diseases. A high resolution algorithm, multivariate matching pursuit, was used to model the murmurs by decomposing them into a series of parametric time-frequency atoms.

"Wave scattering from two-dimensional (2-D) random rough surfaces [three-dimensional (3-D) scattering problem] has been previously analyzed using the sparse-matrix/canonical grid (SM/CG) method. The computational complexity and memory requirement of the SM/CG method are O(N log N) per iteration and O(N), respectively, where N is the number of surface unknowns. Furthermore, the SM/CG method is FFT based, which facilitates the implementation on parallel processors. In this paper, we present a cost-effective solution by implementing the SM/CG method on a Beowulf system consisting of PCs (processors) connected by a 100 Base TX Ethernet switch. The workloads of computing the sparse-matrix-vector multiplication corresponding to the near interactions and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) operations corresponding to the far interactions in the SM/CG method can be easily distributed among all the processors. Both perfectly conducting and lossy dielectric surfaces of Gaussian spectrum and ocean spectrum are analyzed thereafter. When possible, speedup factors against a single processor are given. It is shown that the SM/CG method for a single realization of rough surface scattering can be efficiently adapted for parallel implementation. The largest number of surface unknowns solved in this paper is over 1.5 million. On the other hand, a problem of 131072 surface unknowns for a PEC random rough surface of 1024 square wavelengths only requires a CPU time of less than 20 min. We demonstrate that analysis of a large-scale 2-D random rough surface feasible for a single realization and for one incident angle is possible using the low-cost Beowulf system.","['Shu-Qing Li', 'Chi Hou Chan', 'Leung Tsang', 'Qin Li', 'Lin Zhou']",37,"['02e45603-1853-4163-9a68-a756e4667ee4', '25741ce6-2ea6-42f5-b0bb-635021630b76', '65ccf998-1027-4f1d-a6c0-50a0a153f8cd', '993f9e1a-888d-49fe-8098-affea3a46d03', 'baf21a28-1d9f-497f-80ee-acf454abb380']",Parallel implementation of the sparse-matrix/canonical grid method for the analysis of two-dimensional random rough surfaces (three-dimensional scattering problem) on a Beowulf system,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,2000,4ae465d9-37eb-4a85-8ed7-e1f0bb21fe3c
"As the IC process technology scales the on-chip wiring network becomes denser. Increasing aspect ratios of the on-chip interconnects lead to higher coupling capacitances and ultimately higher cross-talk noise, which degrades signal integrity. In this paper we propose a clamping circuit for on-chip busses, which clamps a victim wire in an on-chip bus based on the states of its immediate aggressors. These clampers help the driver of the victim wire in draining the charge, which is induced due to cross-talk between aggressors and victim wires. This helps in decreasing the cross-talk peak noise and also the delay variability (referred to as delay noise). Simulation results for a 10 mm long communication bus (parallel wires) laid at minimum pitch in 0.13 /spl mu/m CMOS technology show that a reduction of 30%(17.6%), 37%(27.2%) and 26%(65.8%) in cross-talk peak noise amplitude (delay noise) is observed for point to point, parallel repeater inserted and staggered repeater inserted respectively when only immediate neighbours are considered (1/sup st/ order). Furthermore the aggressor-aware clamper is very effective in avoiding glitches, which may occur when more aggressors, in addition to the immediate ones are also switching simultaneously in the same.","['Atul Katoch', 'Maurice Meijer', 'Sanjeev Kimar Jain']",50,[],Active noise cancellation using aggressor-aware clamping circuit for robust on-chip communication,international conference on vlsi design,2005,4ae4beb6-25ba-450b-bf8a-f912a9705a12

"This paper proposes a reconfigurable planar parallel robot by coupling two 2R open kinematic chains (or 2-link robots), the first joints of which are passive. We show that they can reconfigure to a 5R closed kinematic chain which has the same number of actuators as its degrees of freedom. They can also reconfigure to a 4R closed kinematic chain plus one actuated link. The parallel robot has only two actuators but can have multiple functions by reconfigurations. Due to the passive joints, whether or not the 2R open kinematic chains can couple with each other is a non-trivial problem. We propose coupling sequences for forming the 4R and 5R closed kinematic chains and verify those experimentally.","['Osamu Mori', 'Toru Omata']",50,"['16ebf16a-f12a-45f1-9d7d-1c864ef06351', '30903b7b-9189-4d08-909e-c6a08a4b2fb1', '3d0925b0-f2a8-411e-b205-9d240e2e7017', '8dbe598c-035c-4ca6-882d-6e7e3c64ad5f', 'b6283d26-f1f9-41a3-846e-ffeeda3bf1ea', 'db9e0885-0534-45f9-bdfd-99503941e5f8']",Coupling of two 2-link robots with a passive joint for reconfigurable planar parallel robot,international conference on robotics and automation,2002,4ae4fb87-d66c-41f1-86a8-b235aa470ddb
"We address the maximum attainable rate of fingerprinting codes under the marking assumption, studying lower and upper bounds on the value of the rate for various sizes of the attacker coalition. Lower bounds are obtained by considering typical coalitions, which represents a new idea in the area of fingerprinting and enables us to improve the previously known lower bounds for coalitions of size two and three. For upper bounds, the fingerprinting problem is modeled as a communications problem. It is shown that the maximum code rate is bounded above by the capacity of a certain class of channels, which are similar to the multiple-access channel (MAC). Converse coding theorems proved in the paper provide new upper bounds on fingerprinting capacity. It is proved that capacity for fingerprinting against coalitions of size two and three over the binary alphabet satisfies and , respectively. For coalitions of an arbitrary fixed size , we derive an upper bound on fingerprinting capacity in the binary case. Finally, for general alphabets, we establish upper bounds on the fingerprinting capacity involving only single-letter mutual information quantities.","['N.P.

"Methods are investigated for reducing events in sequential circuit fault simulation by reducing the number of faults simulated for each test vector. Inactive faults, which are guaranteed to have no effect on the output or the next state, are identified using local information from the fault-free circuit in one technique. In a second technique, the Star-algorithm is extended to handle sequential circuits and provides global information about inactive faults, based on the fault-free circuit state. Both techniques are integrated into the PROOFS synchronous sequential circuit fault simulator. An average 28% reduction in faulty circuit gate evaluations is obtained for the 19 ISCAS-89 benchmark circuits studied using the first technique, and 33% reduction for the two techniques combined. Execution times decrease by an average of 17% when the first technique is used.

"Signal multipath leads to undesirable tracking errors and inaccurate ranging information for GPS receivers. The extent of the tracking error in compromising the receiver discriminator performance depends on the multipath amplitude, delay, and phase relative to the direct path.

"Scalability of multicast forwarding state is likely to be a major issue facing inter-domain multicast deployment. We present a comprehensive analysis of the multicast forwarding state problem. Our goal is to understand the scaling trends of multicast forwarding state in the Internet, and to explore the intuitions that have motivated state reduction research. We conducted simulation experiments on both real and generated network topologies, with a range of parameters driven by multicast application characteristics. We found that the increase in peering among Internet backbone networks has led to more multicast forwarding state at a handful of core domains, but less state in the rest of the domains. We observed that scalability of multicast forwarding state with respect to session size follows a power law. Our findings show that distribution and concentration of multicast forwarding state in the Internet is significantly, impacted by the application characteristics. We investigated the proposals on non-branching multicast forwarding state elimination, and found substantial reduction is attainable even with very dense multicast sessions.","['Tina Wong', 'Randy H.

"The automatic identification of epileptic EEG signals is significant in both relieving heavy workload of visual inspection of EEG recordings and treatment of epilepsy. This paper presents a novel method based on the theory of sparse representation to identify epileptic EEGs. At first, the raw EEG epochs are preprocessed via Gaussian low pass filtering and differential operation. Then, in the scheme of sparse representation based classification (SRC), a test EEG sample is sparsely represented on the training set by solving l1-minimization problem, and the represented residuals associated with ictal and interictal training samples are computed. The test EEG sample is categorized as the class that yields the minimum represented residual. So unlike the conventional EEG classification methods, the choice and calculation of EEG features are avoided in the proposed framework. Moreover, the kernel trick is employed to generate a kernel version of the SRC method for improving the separability between ictal and interictal classes. The satisfactory recognition accuracy of 98.63% for ictal and interictal EEG classification and for ictal and normal EEG classification has been achieved by the kernel SRC. In addition, the fast speed makes the kernel SRC suit for the real-time seizure monitoring application in the near future.","['Qi Yuan', 'Weidong Zhou', 'Shasha Yuan', 'Xueli Li', 'Jiwen Wang', 'Guijuan Jia']",23,"['005f6a8a-92b8-42df-81e3-896191e71265', '007f89a1-28b8-4c71-86a0-af134b812945', '04dde9db-a85d-41ca-812c-57021dd0aac9', '088a9b3c-d915-445a-94e2-20bf5eb861fc', '0d7197dc-dca7-4eb9-a63e-61a78ba78695', '14d26077-0dde-4832-8b9a-7eddf288ea76', '43770d57-c49e-4294-ad16-63db54ed0687', '4caf717b-60d7-4747-9980-cecae313ec70', '4fe73b17-5167-4cc9-80c3-2a1678165dd5', '5017d094-0827-4c83-879f-4868ed981157', '71554abf-6e74-4759-9600-3cb74484fd6b', '71a18de9-e543-4337-ab7a-3db31d9f8c00', '7236dbb7-f0b2-4e28-bb7c-6de187c32d64', '80ae8b7a-5b9c-4188-bb3c-19652b80636b', '824886b2-3788-4367-aee5-3629a097baa1', '89fef89b-b8e7-49d4-9ede-05af74178a1f', '8d0cced3-f372-4bb3-a5be-ab69d54bc250', '91376bba-3aa3-4855-8634-269262f06ef5', '9806bcb5-d91b-4293-8af0-0bc1b11a6844', '9db8165e-81c9-4ca0-b1d4-33e5278aa4ca', 'ca3db681-afe8-413f-bdd0-688f1230c240', 'd3870e32-232d-4c25-bd73-81cecf9ba267', 'e143bbcb-ce58-4ea6-9890-cc572c8eb1b4', 'e21dae61-3f57-4a96-a772-b835f63010c8', 'e575ddc8-e30c-4bd8-b502-7e33839d89f1', 'f408f2da-d364-4c8c-9573-425db56c3374', 'f84d79fd-4280-4a76-a9f6-73936aa4a979', 'f972a2cd-e4e9-4b92-b39c-22aad723b601']",Epileptic EEG classification based on kernel sparse representation.,International Journal of Neural Systems,2014,4ae5daf5-4de8-438c-ac52-aea730ee18d3
"Continuous shrinking in feature size, increasing power density etc. increase the vulnerability of microprocessors against soft errors even in terrestrial applications. The register file is one of the essential architectural components where soft errors can be very mischievous because errors may rapidly spread from there throughout the whole system. Thus, register files are recognized as one of the major concerns when it comes to reliability. This paper introduces Self-Immunity, a technique that improves the integrity of the register file with respect to soft errors. Based on the observation that a certain number of register bits are not always used to represent a value stored in a register. This paper deals with the difficulty to exploit this obvious observation to enhance the register file integrity against soft errors. We show that our technique can reduce the vulnerability of the register file considerably while exhibiting smaller overhead in terms of area and power consumption compared to state-of-the-art in register file protection.","['Hussam Amrouch', 'Joerg Henkel']",50,"['04c49e4c-48e1-4413-a719-ae7349a91607', '28338ed7-6aa6-4233-bb20-1d962cd65430', '52f1d13a-1dcd-4634-b27e-7af848dfdcee', '632961be-26dc-489a-8e5f-f03fe5467cf1', '707ff258-9fcc-4e75-8afd-83da9f0c7580', '8016f6e7-c038-4b41-9fe9-50dc6b48a1f2', '8d2338f6-231e-4f51-9e69-40fc6b3fa96a', '99fce5fd-438b-45dd-b548-0e832ccf9836', 'a3471bd4-21ab-4b82-ab82-fc9bb42632d4', 'a51e516c-144d-42b7-afac-58741ea12398', 'b867bf81-6431-4b4c-94b6-91797b14046b', 'c4b4d4a1-ba76-4937-ae92-6003f2ba9866', 'dfa704b7-3502-486d-88e5-b8a2a819e031', 'ea528442-c497-4b26-8d04-7e5ac01d1dfe', 'f1afcf97-588f-4e03-ac2e-c49c932772c9', 'fc8f998b-8837-4610-84e7-b376a100f83a']",Self-Immunity Technique to Improve Register File Integrity Against Soft Errors,international conference on vlsi design,2011,4ae5ddc2-df81-4b72-94dc-010ac34bab48

"Radiation-induced soft errors have emerged as a key challenge in computer system design. If the industry is to continue to provide customers with the level of reliability they expect, microprocessor architects must address this challenge directly. This effort has two parts. First, architects must understand the impact of soft errors on their designs. Second, they must select judiciously from among available techniques to reduce this impact in order to meet their reliability targets with minimum overhead. To provide a foundation for these efforts, this paper gives a broad overview of the soft error problem from an architectural perspective. We start with basic definitions, followed by a description of techniques to compute the soft error rate. Then, we summarize techniques used to reduce the soft error rate. This paper also describes problems with double-bit errors. Finally, this paper outlines future directions for architecture research in soft errors.","['Shubhendu S. Mukherjee', 'Joel S.

"A technique for representing and recognising 3-D or space curves is presented. In the proposed algorithm, the space curves are represented by a set of two zero-crossing representations which are constructed based on the dyadic wavelet transform. These representations are then described in the form of an ordered set of complex numbers which is referred to as the compact representation of the space curves. A string-matching technique is adapted for comparing two curves using their compact representations. Experimental results show that the proposed technique can be used for recognising space curves under similarity transformation with and without additive noise.","['Q. Tieng', 'Wageeh W.

"This paper presents five exploratory trials investigating scenarios likely to occur when a personal robot shares a home with a person. The scenarios are: a human and robot working on a collaborative task, a human and robot sharing a physical space in a domestic setting, a robot recording and revealing personal information, a robot interrupting a human in order to serve them, and finally, a robot seeking assistance from a human through various combinations of physical and verbal cues. Findings indicate that participants attribute more blame and less credit to a robot than compared to themselves when working together on a collaborative task. Safety is a main concern when determining participants' comfort when sharing living space with their robot. Findings suggest that the robot should keep its interruption of the user's activities to a minimum. Participants were happy for the robot to store information which is essential for the robot to improve its functionality. However, their main concerns were related to the storing of sensitive information and security measures to safeguard such information.","['Kheng Lee Koay', 'Dag Sverre Syrdal', 'Michael L.

"Generation of test vectors for the VLSI devices used in contemporary digital system is becoming much more difficult as these devices increase in size. Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) techniques are commonly used to generate these tests. Since ATPG is an NP complete problem with complexity exponential to circuit size, the application of parallel processing techniques to accelerate the process of finding test patterns is an active area of research. This paper presents an approach to parallelization of the test generation problem that is targeted to a network-of-workstations environment. The system is based upon partitioning of the fault list across multiple processors and includes enhancements designed to address the main drawbacks of this technique, namely unequal load balancing and generation of redundant vectors. The technique is generalized enough that it can be applied to any test generation system regardless of the ATPG or fault simulation algorithm employed. Results were gathered to determine the impact of workstation processing load and network communications load on the performance of the system. >","['Robert H. Klenke', 'Lori M. Kaufman', 'James H.

"Mobility, channel error, and congestion are the main causes for packet loss in mobile ad hoc networks. Reducing packet loss typically involves congestion control operating on top of a mobility and failure adaptive routing protocol at the network layer. In the current designs, routing is not congestion-adaptive. Routing may let a congestion happen which is detected by congestion control, but dealing with congestion in this reactive manner results in longer delay and unnecessary packet loss and requires significant overhead if a new route is needed. This problem becomes more visible especially in large-scale transmission of heavy traffic such as multimedia data, where congestion is more probable and the negative impact of packet loss on the service quality is of more significance. We argue that routing should not only be aware of, but also be adaptive to, network congestion. Hence, we propose a routing protocol (CRP) with such properties. Our ns-2 simulation results confirm that CRP improves the packet loss rate and end-to-end delay while enjoying significantly smaller protocol overhead and higher energy efficiency as compared to AODV and DSR","['Duc A.

"Bus systems are used in computers as essential architecture, and dependability of bus systems should be accomplished reasonably for various applications. In this paper, we will present dependable bus operations with actual implementation and evaluation by CPLD. Most of the bus systems control transition of some classified phases with synchronous clock or guard time to avoid incorrect phase transition. However, these phase control methods may degrade system performance or cause incorrect operations. We design an asynchronous sequential circuit for bus phase control without clock or guard time. This circuit prevents incorrect phase transition at the time when large input delay or erroneous input occurs. We estimate probability of incorrect phase transition with single stuck-at fault on input signals. From the result of estimation, we also design checking system verifying outputs of initiator and target devices. Incorrect phase transition with single stuck-at fault occurred between both sequential circuits is inhibited completely by implementation of the system.","['Yasumasa Hayashi', 'Takashi Matsubara', 'Yoshiaki Koga']",50,[],Implementation and evaluation for dependable bus control using CPLD,pacific rim international symposium on dependable computing,2000,4ae67525-5c1c-499d-b101-fce800c72de9

Unlike previous works, we found that flow sampling is not always better than packet sampling to continue detecting portscans reliably.","['Ignasi Paredes-Oliva', 'Pere Barlet-Ros', 'Josep Solé-Pareta']",29,"['2bab136a-728b-4664-8a77-8555ef22feb6', '49f156d0-2b3a-45d3-9502-a239820eec23', '5f1381bd-a165-4c63-bb2e-b6e457cc6067', 'a59be9de-2672-4f92-8ff6-636b3afbce68', 'e610c646-d376-4694-b694-727094d25afc', 'e93140f8-ff5c-45c0-abd2-57dd471f4ed0', 'f3392a9a-7b89-44a8-b92e-f6a182b7cf8b']",Portscan Detection with Sampled NetFlow,traffic monitoring and analysis,2009,4ae6853d-8c55-4f2b-8e0f-5e25a4d3312e
"Named entity recognition plays an important role in many natural language processing applications. While considerable attention has been pain in the past to research issues related to named entity recognition, few studies have been reported on the recognition of nested named entities. This paper presents a morpheme-based method to Chinese nested named entity recognition. To approach this task, we first employ the logistic regression model to extract multi-level entity morphemes from an entity-tagged corpus, and thus explore a variety of lexical features under the framework of conditional random fields to perform Chinese nested named entity recognition. Our experimental results on different data set show that our system is effective for most nested named entities under evaluation.","['Chunyuan Fu', 'Guohong Fu']",0,"['0a053a8a-f302-4110-b1e1-11b17b13ba3e', '4d87d9b2-88a2-4de3-8792-ae2ae1975624', '6611d8b1-83da-42a8-b87b-0be32b2c0beb', '7b66019a-cf68-4e53-adb0-65121ac0e191', 'a2c5a3a2-a786-4135-a71b-f2d091611ce1', 'ae829318-5d10-461d-9c99-34a95a3f8732', 'b8bd186a-bff8-4cb0-8137-a390378777b2']",Morpheme-based chinese nested named entity recognition,fuzzy systems and knowledge discovery,2011,4ae69fdd-94f1-405b-ac28-90cfe06df829
"The Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is a delay sensitive traffic due to real-time applications on networks. The assessment of voice flow quality in the VoIP is an essential requirement for technical and commercial motivation. The packets of VoIP streaming may experience drops because of the competition among the different kinds of traffic flow over the network. A VoIP application is also sensitive to delay and requires the voice packets to arrive on time from the sender to the receiver side without any delay over WLAN. The scheduling system model for VoIP traffic is an unresolved problem. In this research paper, the author proposes a new Voice Priority Queue (VPQ) scheduling system models and algorithms for the VoIP over WLANs to solve scheduling issues over IP-based networks. They present new contributions, through the three stages of the VPQ. The VPQ scheduling algorithm is provided as an essential technique in the VoIP communication networks to guarantee the QoS requirements. The design of the VPQ is managed by the limited bandwidth utilization and has been proven to have an efficient performance over WLANs.",['Kashif Nisar'],0,"['05045063-3d75-443c-bc99-fd4265026753', '27487fa9-924a-4b77-9812-77dd9f5113e8', '3b8090ef-01ae-4498-a0ec-f5e4a886e93d', '468c53d8-d50c-4440-9179-ff512a0deaba', '4ab1824c-d2ff-41aa-a5bd-d62a439de205', '4c8eff08-a3e1-41e8-8583-899764d9324c', '603071b1-3395-42fb-8088-10f0f103f584', '6a78e12d-cd62-43c7-80d6-b5b2006771eb', '8a5f5e6a-0055-4f9b-9fa0-68cd620391a8', 'ae342e36-25a7-4021-ad76-e8790fcba60d', 'b721eac1-dd86-47c0-960d-8943fd1e726b']",Voice Priority Queue Scheduling System Models for VoIP over WLANs,International Journal of Information Communication Technologies and Human Development,2013,4ae6c496-241a-45f9-bf94-04b025580425
"Given a single record, the authors consider the problem of estimating the parameters of a harmonic signal buried in noise. The observed data are modeled as a sinusoidal signal plus additive Gaussian noise of unknown covariance. The authors define novel higher order statistics-referred to as ""mixed"" cumulants-that can be consistently estimated using a single record and are insensitive to colored Gaussian noise. Employing fourth-order mixed cumulants, they estimate the sinusoid parameters using a consistent, nonlinear matching approach. The algorithm requires an initial estimate that is obtained from a consistent, linear estimator. Finally, the authors examine the performance of the proposed method via simulations. >","['John M. M.

"Formal analysis of security protocols is largely based on a set of assumptions commonly referred to as the Dolev-Yao model. Two formalisms that state the basic assumptions of this model are related here: strand spaces and multiset rewriting with existential quantification. Strand spaces provide a simple and economical approach to analysis of completed protocol runs by emphasizing causal interactions among protocol participants. The multiset rewriting formalism provides a very precise way of specifying finite-length protocols with unboundedly many instances of each protocol role, such as client, server, initiator, or responder. A number of modifications to each system are required to produce a meaningful comparison. In particular, we extend the strand formalism with a way of incrementally growing bundles in order to emulate an execution of a protocol with parametric strands. The correspondence between the modified formalisms directly relates the intruder theory from the multiset rewriting formalism to the penetrator strands. The relationship we illustrate here between multiset rewriting specifications and strand spaces thus suggests refinements to both frameworks, and deepens our understanding of the Dolev-Yao model.","['Iliano Cervesato', 'Nancy A.

"In this paper, we propose a high-speed and programmable traffic management mechanism to enable easy and timely innovations. A control framework introduced by 4D, Tesseract, or OpenFlow, separates control functions from the switch nodes to a control server so that a variety of network control policies can be implemented outside of the switches. Within this framework, we propose a mechanism to enable flexible flow-based traffic management so that a variety of innovative traffic management schemes can be realized. Per-flow traffic management, however, requires packet-by-packet state updates, which can spoil this control framework. The proposed mechanism consists of a control server that monitors traffic conditions using sampled packets sent from the switches and calculates per-flow packet discarding rate, and switches that discard incoming packets according to the discarding rate. Packet sampling and discarding do not require packet-by-packet state handling at the switches and thus allows controls from a control server. We also propose a mechanism to compress the discarding information using a time series of bloom filters, so that frequent control updates are allowed. We tested the mechanism with per-flow WFQ emulation and the simulation results showed very good per-flow fairness. Furthermore, we found that the flow table is compressed 600 times smaller and that the processing cost at the server and the switches is small enough for use with 10 Gbps links.","['Hideyuki Shimonishi', 'Takashi Yoshikawa', 'Atsushi Iwata']",2,"['05e892c8-a6d4-4122-9e93-dee9b83cba90', '077aa70e-b736-42af-ab8f-d41fb52c2150', '0ac9b888-1bc4-467d-a83e-b8b664aed73c', '1201ca94-1577-49b0-9c34-2d486840efb9', '5477474b-c802-4696-b2e5-57a8f6bd14ae', '7102b3ee-aa75-4b7d-936b-3270c956d726', '7398f3eb-b3b2-4567-b955-171825aad912', '73ee6424-c8a8-4b8b-b9cd-204dd614a8c7', 'e53c8efb-d371-4e26-910a-a57bdac34982']",Off-the-path flow handling mechanism forhigh-speed and programmable traffic management,acm special interest group on data communication,2008,4ae6da9e-f496-4247-bed3-c40ffba6a038

"The techniques commonly used in image coding (JPEG, MPEG, ...) have as the main objective to compress as much as possible while retaining most of the information. These methods are often based on the use of the discrete cosine transform (DCT) and the wavelet transform (WT). Our purpose is to consider the necessary redundancy to achieve a good reception in the case of heavy interruptions of bits transmission. There is however a contradiction between an optimal compression and the redundancy required. It is thus necessary to master and compress the information to be transmitted as much as possible and to withstand the noise on the transmission channel. This article makes a contribution to this difficult problem: its originality resides in the coupling of orthogonal transforms and a redundant transform. Simulation results are provided using our method and the results are compared with that of DCT and WT based methods for Lena and Mountain images.","['A.-M.

"In this paper, we present an extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based solution for the estimation of the angular motion using a gyro-free inertial measurement unit (GF-IMU) built of twelve separate mono-axial accelerometers. Using such a GF-IMU produces a vector, which we call the angular information vector (AIV) that consists of 3D angular acceleration terms and six quadratic terms of angular velocities. We consider the multiple distributed orthogonal triads of accelerometers that consist of three nonplanar distributed triads equally spaced from a central triad as a specific case to solve. During research for the possible filter schemes, we derived equality constraints. Hence we incorporate the constraints in the filter to improve the accuracy of the angular motion estimation, which in turn improves the attitude accuracy (direction cosine matrix (DCM) or quaternion vector).","['Ezzaldeen Edwan', 'Stefan Knedlik', 'Otmar Loffeld']",50,"['1dc6b025-796e-4099-8620-a079d9e12230', '78af5b0d-1e27-4db6-8bfd-97d050660c8c', '8622c1a0-5304-40c1-aaa8-7ee9312f979e', 'dd9c874c-f66a-4917-8481-1831015fd625']",Constrained Angular Motion Estimation in a Gyro-Free IMU,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2011,4ae78278-7eb6-4f96-b785-d28b43ff31e7
"This paper begins to identify and characterize the knowledge used by experienced librarians while searching for subject information in online catalogs. Ten experienced librarians performed the same set of six subject searches in an online catalog. Investigated was the knowledge used to solve retrieval problems. This knowledge represents expertise in the use of the catalog. Data were collected through the use of think-aloud protocols, transaction logs, and structured interviews. Knowledge was defined as knowledge of objects (factual knowledge), knowledge of events (experiential knowledge), knowledge of performance (process knowledge), and metaknowledge. Metaknowledge is the sense of whole derived from the integration of factual, process, and experiential knowledge about the search and the conditions under which it is performed. The focus of this paper is on metaknowledge. For evidence of metaknowledge the data were examined for explanations that participants gave for their actions and observations, and for ways that participants evaluated their own progress during the process of searching. Reasons and explanations given by searchers were related to all phases of the library information retrieval process from the user's receipt of material to policies for collection development, and not just events directly related to the performance of a particular search task.",['Tschera Harkness Connell'],50,"['41b3bfc0-1c1d-49d9-a5aa-d9a714d12408', '972c751b-733e-4362-8b6b-c9910c06b355', 'a8743d27-1912-424a-a24b-3b670d3c15c3', 'b5db4568-de6c-4965-aa40-cf8520d6f75f', 'c5bdcf65-a735-4dcf-a5cc-158eedd8acc6']",Subject searching in online catalogs: metaknowledge used by experienced searchers,Journal of The American Society for Information Science,1995,4ae79d08-8f47-475d-8f19-8e3d6a9572e5
"We propose injection-locked clocking (ILC) to combat deteriorating clock skew and jitter, and reduce power consumption in high-performance microprocessors. In the new clocking scheme, injection-locked oscillators are used as local clock receivers. Compared to conventional clocking with buffered trees or grids, ILC can achieve better power efficiency, lower jitter, and much simpler skew compensation thanks to its built-in deskewing capability. Unlike other alternatives, ILC is fully compatible with conventional clock distribution networks. In this paper, a quantitative study based on circuit and microarchitectural-level simulations is performed. Alpha21264 is used as the baseline processor, and is scaled to 0.13 m and 3 GHz. Simulations show 20- and 23-ps jitter reduction, 10.1% and 17% power savings in two ILC configurations. A test chip distributing 5-GHz clock is implemented in a standard 0.18- m CMOS technology and achieved excellent jitter performance and a deskew range up to 80 ps.","['Lin Zhang', 'Aaron Carpenter', 'Berkehan Ciftcioglu', 'Alok Garg', 'Michael C.

"This paper describes a novel technique for position error compensations of robots based on a fuzzy error interpolation method. A traditional robot calibration implements either model or modelless methods. The compensation of position error in a model-less method is to move the robot's end-effector to a target position in the robot workspace, and to find the target position error online based on the measured neighboring four-point errors around the target position. For this purpose, a stereo camera or other measurement device can be used to measure offline the position errors of the robot's end-effector at predefined grid points. By using the proposed fuzzy error interpolation technique, the accuracy of the position error compensation can be greatly improved, which is confirmed by the simulation results given in this paper. A comparison study among various interpolation methods, such as bilinear, cubic spline, and the fuzzy error interpolation technique is also made via simulation. The simulation results show that more accurate compensation results can be achieved using the fuzzy error interpolation technique compared with its bilinear and cubic spline counterparts.","['Ying Bai', 'Hanqi Zhuang']",16,"['1aba91b5-6a0e-4ef2-82d7-81e5a9148073', 'cbbbc128-08cb-49a0-89dd-e5645191c523', 'e51085ae-3236-4f1a-95e1-2ed751be3a3a', 'ee9eb92a-56f8-47cc-8a4a-fff297ec69dc']","On the comparison of bilinear, cubic spline, and fuzzy interpolation techniques for robotic position measurements",IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,2005,4ae85f9e-9dcc-43b6-8a7c-1a8ddb76b0a2
"Different from traditional one-sided clustering techniques, coclustering makes use of the duality between samples and features to partition them simultaneously. Most of the existing co-clustering algorithms focus on modeling the relationship between samples and features, whereas the intersample and interfeature relationships are ignored. In this paper, we propose a novel coclustering algorithm named Locally Discriminative Coclustering (LDCC) to explore the relationship between samples and features as well as the intersample and interfeature relationships. Specifically, the sample-feature relationship is modeled by a bipartite graph between samples and features. And we apply local linear regression to discovering the intrinsic discriminative structures of both sample space and feature space. For each local patch in the sample and feature spaces, a local linear function is estimated to predict the labels of the points in this patch. The intersample and interfeature relationships are thus captured by minimizing the fitting errors of all the local linear functions. In this way, LDCC groups strongly associated samples and features together, while respecting the local structures of both sample and feature spaces. Our experimental results on several benchmark data sets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.","['Lijun Zhang', 'Chun Chen', 'Jiajun Bu', 'Zhengguang Chen', 'Deng Cai', 'Jiawei Han']",50,"['15c30ca5-6af6-4acf-b8c5-f2c0e18e6ad8', '1ad7a27f-78ae-4598-9642-5285f908629e', '290befe7-33d8-4a93-adff-20fad01ad561', '2a5d821b-14a8-4dca-a0bc-8f20e4bd45ea', '4128fbca-6f5e-42cd-b8c8-50c17dfbf563', '4a48669e-ce7d-4a67-a9ff-dd9a2814832f', '60013651-9f84-4c1a-9ffe-c3af7a557c3c', '7ec5f06e-2fe3-495a-84a0-94fcfe08bb7b', '89db90e1-86af-4250-828a-606b79a7461e', '8a03439f-67ec-4a40-b430-d14620fe73b6', '94b095a5-74ad-47ec-a39d-8dc877b2ef1e', '9b26f592-ea31-4600-9089-88c973ca1748', 'a3629d9a-4bb9-420c-8579-7f0a4adc4d3a', 'ac14afe6-de4d-4056-b2ac-0f6e36f369a2', 'b7a1c0d9-c367-4e97-93ed-80872c42d9cd', 'bba5b861-70a6-47d8-96aa-e2722d016253', 'c472bfe1-9ef6-43c6-89b5-a86b22c9f5df', 'cbff2ff2-6b8f-425d-a5ef-aff0de9be3e5', 'de322ef7-795c-48a7-adaa-6c2300752c08', 'e3a40536-5580-4c24-b273-4fa4dab2579e', 'ea8cd3d8-17ae-4a1e-8f83-1609469087af', 'ede9c372-c77f-414c-969a-6032ecf57f02', 'f72df36b-bdd9-4342-9299-9eb2e3cfdfbe', 'fd13421d-6aeb-4afe-81df-ce04ebee4fdc']",Locally Discriminative Coclustering,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2012,4ae86532-94f9-4553-b503-248e4468e4a5
"In current developmental research, one of the challenging tasks is to understand the spatio-temporal gene expression patterns and the relationships among different genes. In situ hybridization (ISH) assay which shows mRNA spatio-temporal expression patterns in cells and tissues directly is currently widely utilized in the bench work. With the increasing of available ISH images, automatic annotation systems are highly demanded. In this paper, an automatic classification system is proposed for annotating the in situ hybridization images with respect to the developmental stages. The embryo is first segmented from the original image, registered and normalized. The segmented embryo image is then divided into 100 blocks from which the pixel intensity and texture features are extracted and discretized. The multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) based association classification approach is proposed to generate classification rules for different stages based on the training data set. The testing instance is classified by applying the rules generated in the training process and a classification coordination module is incorporated to resolve the conflicts utilizing the weights derived from angle values in the MCA procedure. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves promising results and outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms.","['Tao Meng', 'Mei Ling Shyu']",50,"['28254584-968a-4a1d-8c3b-f400a50cbfee', '2e4ee4ab-b0f9-4e56-a208-5c4a2f4543b7', '62a46780-e1d9-4186-babe-6179735d785e', '7cdca991-1a74-43e9-9847-909de64fdd84', 'd20df5c3-667b-42d4-a128-d5f0b649cc32']",Automatic annotation of drosophila developmental stages using association classification and information integration,information reuse and integration,2011,4ae866e8-0297-4c7e-abfd-7b88008928d6
"The potentials of mean force (PMFs) were determined for systems forming cationic and anionic homocomplexes composed of acetic acid, phenol, isopropylamine, n-butylamine, imidazole, and 4(5)-methylimidazole, and their conjugated bases or acids, respectively, in three solvents with different polarity and hydrogen-bonding propensity: acetonitrile (AN), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and water (H 2 O). For each pair and each solvent a series of umbrella-sampling molecular dynamics simulations with the AMBER force field, explicit solvent, and counterions added to maintain a zero net charge of a system were carried out and the PMF was calculated by using the Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM). Subsequently, homoconjugation-equilibrium constants were calculated by numerical integration of the respective PMF profiles. In all cases but imidazole stable homocomplexes were found to form in solution, which was manifested as the presence of contact minima corresponding to hydrogen-bonded species in the PMF curves. The calculated homoconjugation constants were found to be greater for complexes with the OHO bridge (acetic acid and phenol) than with the NHN bridge and they were found to decrease with increasing polarity and hydrogen-bonding propensity of the solvent (i.e., in the series AN > DMSO > H 2 O), both facts being in agreement with the available experimental data. It was also found that interactions with counterions are manifested as the broadening of the contact minimum or appearance of additional minima in the PMF profiles of the acetic acid-acetate, phenol/ phenolate system in acetonitrile, and the 4(5)-methylimidazole/4(5)-methylimidzole cation conjugated base system in dimethyl sulfoxide.","['Joanna Makowska', 'Mariusz Makowski', 'Adam Liwo', 'Lech Chmurzyński']",12,"['733b0918-6e52-416a-a558-0c5c98152057', 'babc0dc1-eb3e-403f-b5e5-68c31725c1fc']",Theoretical calculations of homoconjugation equilibrium constants in systems modeling acid-base interactions in side chains of biomolecules using the potential of mean force.,Journal of Computational Chemistry,2005,4ae88cb8-ba8a-494f-a398-12e47ef23d54

"We present a novel method of velocity field estimation for points on moving contours in an image sequence. The method determines the corresponding point in the next image frame by considering curvature changes at each point on a contour. In previous methods, there are errors in estimation for the points which have low curvature variations since those methods compute the solutions by approximating the normal component of optical flow. The proposed method computes optical flow vectors of contour points by minimizing the curvature changes. As a first step, snakes are used to locate smooth curves in 2D imagery. Then, the extracted curves are tracked continuously. We excluded the rearranging process in snakes and allowed the snaxel distance to vary. Each point on a contour has a unique corresponding point in the nest frame. Experimental results showed that the proposed method computes accurate optical flow vectors for various moving contours.","['Jong Seung Park', 'Joon Hee Han']",3,"['1c63e1d5-b963-455b-829d-e4f3eb63a36a', '32148a0b-6ce4-4a1e-a1d2-98a96b27b24f', '3a2dec7e-8ea0-4bf8-90d0-48f398200a66', '93a5ad9b-7ab6-49ae-86d8-16f8137be7c6', 'a95059e2-7658-426c-bf6a-10771dc855b4', 'c349411e-b528-42ba-b046-b2598b22fff7', 'ef330947-bc34-4f55-834b-40469ee33769']",A curvature-based approach to contour motion estimation,international conference on computer vision,1998,4ae8b16f-dbd4-4ace-ae6f-edb6affb036c

"Power density is a growing problem in high-performance processors in which small, high-activity resources overheat. Two categories of techniques, temporal and spatial, can address power density in a processor. Temporal solutions slow computation and heating either through frequency and voltage scaling or through stopping computation long enough to allow the processor to cool; both degrade performance. Spatial solutions reduce heat by moving computation from a hot resource to an alternate resource (e.g., a spare ALU) to allow cooling. Spatial solutions are appealing because they have negligible impact on performance, but they require availability of spatial slack in the form of spare or underutilized resource copies. Previous work focusing on spatial slack within a pipeline has proposed adding extra resource copies to the pipeline, which adds substantial complexity because the resources that overheat, issue logic, register files, and ALUs, are the resources in some of the tightest critical paths in the pipeline. Previous work has not considered exploiting the spatial slack already existing within pipeline resource copies. Utilization can be quite asymmetric across resource copies, leaving some copies substantially cooler than others. We observe that asymmetric utilization within copies of three key back-end resources, the issue queue, register files, and ALUs, creates spatial slack opportunities. By balancing asymmetry in their utilization, we can reduce power density. Scheduling policies for these resources were designed for maximum simplicity before power density was a concern; our challenge is to address asymmetric heating while keeping the pipeline simple. Balancing asymmetric utilization reduces the need for other performance-degrading temporal power-density techniques. While our techniques do not obviate temporal techniques in high-resource-utilization applications, we greatly reduce their use, improving overall performance.","['Michael D.

"This paper reports an efficient discrete cosine transform (DCT) processing for the JPEG algorithm using a massive-parallel memory-embedded SIMD matrix processor. The matrix-processing engine has 2,048 2-bit processing elements, which are connected by a flexible switching network, and supports 2-bit 2,048-way bit-serial and word-parallel operations with a single command. For compatibility with this matrix-processing architecture, the conventional DCT algorithm has been improved in arithmetic order and the vertical/horizontal-space 1 dimensional (1D)-DCT processing has been further developed. Evaluation results of the matrix-engine-based DCT processing show that the necessary clock cycles per image blocks can be reduced by 87% in comparison to a conventional DSP architecture. The determined performances in MOPS and MOPS/mm are factors 8 and 5.6 better than with a conventional DSP, respectively. Moreover, the matrix-processing engine can reduce the number of total clock cycles for JPEG application about 49% in comparison to a conventional DSP architecture.","['Takeshi Kumaki', 'Tetsushi Koide', 'Hans Jürgen Mattausch', 'Yasuto Kuroda', 'Hideyuki Noda', 'Katsumi Dosaka', 'Kazutami Arimoto', 'Kazunori Saito']",2,[],Efficient Vertical/Horizontal-Space 1D-DCT Processing Based on Massive-Parallel Matrix-Processing Engine,international symposium on circuits and systems,2007,4ae8dcf6-f6ae-4950-ad3c-b560503ffa11
"Modern search engines use link structure of the World Wide Web in order to gain better results for ranking the results of users' queries. One of the most popular ranking algorithms which is based on link analysis is HITS. It generates very accurate outputs but because of huge amount of online computations, this algorithm is relatively slow. In this paper we introduce PHITS, a parallelized version of the HITS algorithm that is suitable for working with huge web graphs in a reason- able time. For implementing this algorithm, we use WebGraph framework and we focus on parallelizing access to web graph as the main bottleneck in the HITS algorithm. I. INTRODUCTION Search technology is one of the most important reasons for success of the web. The huge amount of information available on the web, its high growth rate, and its unstructured nature, all increase the need for search engines with high performance and accurate results. One of the major components of each search engine is its ranking algorithm. Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) systems usually use some models like VMS (4) and compute rank of results using content similarity measures between user's query and retrieved documents. But in the context of the web, there are some problems with these approaches. For example, spamming may lead to inefficient ranking. Some methods have been proposed to encounter these problems most of which uses some implicit information which is embedded in the web graph. These methods are known as Link-Analysis based algorithms. PageRank (5) and HITS (Hyperlink Induced Topic Search) (1) are the most well known algorithms in this category. PageRank, which is used by Google for ranking its results, is an offline and query-independent ranking algorithm. This means that the ranking is independent of the specific queries of users and therefore can be done once and used for all of the upcoming queries. On the other hand, HITS is an online and query-dependent algorithm. Being query dependent makes HITS more precise but it has some disadvantages too. In fact, required online computations for this algorithm is too much and the response time of the search engine after submitting queries by users is not acceptable. To overcome this problem, in this paper we will exploit the parallel processing methods to improve the execution performance of the algorithm. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section II, link-analysis based algorithms in general and HITS as a special case are discussed. At the end of this section, some of the variations and improvements for the HITS algorithm that are suggested in the literature are also described. Implementing the HITS algorithm and its parallel version, PHITS, are discussed in sections III and IV respectively. Finally, last section of this paper contains conclusion and some ideas for future work in this topic.","['Yasser Ganji Saffar', 'Kyumars Sheykh Esmaili', 'Mohammad Ghodsi', 'Hassan Abolhassani']",0,"['2256cad0-cf03-42da-bcf3-4a89be0ebf8e', '3c8a10d2-062f-4875-9b60-257bc801dba1', '44cdac4f-a897-482d-ad5a-7b55d3e8457a', '529f0775-01b2-4f1e-9d89-fc5227058019', '8c6fbd87-dd3b-4c22-9836-0427a29237de', '8f9e92cf-f266-4e51-807f-c098a260a0dc', '943b9c7e-0003-48d5-a2b1-346a6987ca8d', '97ce7ea4-bd5e-4529-ac35-69b954643fae', 'c7e4e04b-45da-4bae-8c8a-d17ca0087361']",Parallel Online Ranking of Web Pages,acs/ieee international conference on computer systems and applications,2006,4ae8e45c-1b78-4023-bd03-f85df9b25d57
"We describe a theory of authentication and a system that implements it. Our theory is based on the notion of principal and a ""speaks for"" relation between principals. A simple principal either has a name or is a communication channel; a compound principal can express an adopted role or delegation of authority. The theory explains how to reason about a principal's authority by deducing the other principals that it can speak for; authenticating a channel is one important application. We use the theory to explain many existing and proposed mechanisms for security. In particular, we describe the system we have built. It passes principals efficiently as arguments or results of remote procedure calls, and it handles public and shared key encryption, name lookup in a large name space, groups of principals, loading programs, delegation, access control, and revocation.","['Butler W.

"Human gait is an important biometric feature. It can be perceived from a great distance and has recently attracted greater attention in video-surveillance-related applications, such as closed-circuit television. We explore gait recognition based on a matrix representation in this paper. First, binary silhouettes over one gait cycle are averaged. As a result, each gait video sequence, containing a number of gait cycles, is represented by a series of gray-level averaged images. Then, a matrix-based unsupervised algorithm, namely coupled subspace analysis (CSA), is employed as a preprocessing step to remove noise and retain the most representative information. Finally, a supervised algorithm, namely discriminant analysis with tensor representation, is applied to further improve classification ability. This matrix-based scheme demonstrates a much better gait recognition performance than state-of-the-art algorithms on the standard USF HumanID Gait database","['Dong Xu', 'Shuicheng Yan', 'Dacheng Tao', 'Lei Zhang', 'Xuelong Li', 'Hong-Jiang Zhang']",124,"['05eda871-7c1b-45f0-a540-65625a6b4abb', '0af61588-ee62-495b-b114-5355fed4d697', '1a3f9254-1884-4ae2-ac64-2f16fb541ba8', '1fbb8928-78af-4bbf-aa79-90aa18b3c73d', '2bdf4d4c-baf1-4695-9d86-d4b0ba17f93c', '2d60934c-c3aa-44ac-803c-4e756b6fd09d', '3453e2e4-3294-40ea-84b5-6c41ba1e5dfc', '3b1f0f22-5de3-48e2-812e-b741a6b98e01', '56f4b72a-ec39-47ac-8220-899296e7fb18', '571157c0-69e5-473e-8d81-ef677057ca6c', '6cba639f-fb82-4b94-aba0-28c7b4806684', '7276750a-42f3-4baf-9aa3-86daad3e70f4', '73c43c50-fa06-4628-9a92-2e198cbbd15a', '7eda9b91-21f1-490f-8ef2-f94e81c558a4', '8553f82e-487e-4d57-be72-4da7b5c44dfb', '8bc815d3-80a5-4beb-85b5-e72c7ac17f5a', 'a92b30c0-9291-4edd-9ca4-325d0e6b0e58', 'ab77e492-f4f5-43ca-ac25-6e86dd3c0a57', 'b3f8d3f4-4471-4df7-aa20-ac4ea05afecb', 'ba743ee1-0382-492c-b5fb-de7fdf58cb61', 'bca48a8c-98d8-404f-b601-4eec9cf0a703', 'c41ecd03-72ef-4b12-97fc-da8012955ab5', 'e0de38dc-6266-49d1-9f4b-11049641bedc']",Human Gait Recognition With Matrix Representation,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology,2006,4ae90bfa-7952-486f-993c-11055b41e0d5
"This paper introduces a new concept of hierarchical testability called Single-Port-Change (SPC) two-pattern testability. We propose a non-scan design-for-testability (DFT) method which makes each path that needs to be tested in a data path SPC two-pattern testable. An SPC two-pattern test guarantees robust (resp. non-robust) test if the path is robust (resp. non-robust) testable. Since it is easy to find justification paths for SPC two-pattern tests at register-transfer level, the proposed DFT method can reduce hardware overhead compared to that of our previous DFT method for arbitrary two-pattern tests. Furthermore, we propose a method to reduce test generation effort by removing a subset of sequentially untestable paths from targets of test generation. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce hardware overhead without losing the quality of test.","['Y.

"Many data analysts require tools which can integrate their database management packages (e.g. Microsoft Access) with their data analysis ones (e.g. SAS, SPSS), and provide guidance for the selection of appropriate mining algorithms. In addition, the analysts need to extract and validate statistical results to facilitate data mining.

The former examines the scheme and instances to determine appropriate association measurement functions (e.g, chi-square, linear regression, ANOVA). The latter involves the appropriate statistical function on a sample data set, and extracts relevant statistical output such as /spl eta//sup 2/, and R/sup 2/ for effective mining of data.

"In this paper we compare and discuss the performance of a boiler evaporator system when the system is controlled by a traditional PID-type strategy and when the system is enhanced by using fuzzy logic blocks to provide set-points for the system. The strategy used in fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs) is called fuzzy supervisory control and it generates set-points for the conventional controllers. The boiler under test is a VU-60 industrial system that produces 180,000 pounds of steam per hour. The mathematical model of the plant is a scaled version model of that obtained for a thermoelectric unit. The new model simplifies the large-scale thermoelectric boiler model to an industrial small-scale type VU-60 boiler model based upon first principle mass and energy balance equations. The main change consists of representing only the behavior of the drum—evaporator system, having a partial model of the combustion process, with a simplified combustion control system and a three-element boiler feed-water controller. The control system for combustion and boiler feed-water receives a supervisory signal (or set-point tracking signal) that comes from the FLC to improve the performance of the overall control system. The behavior of the supervisory controller brings some advantages to the system performance, compared with the traditional control schemes. The comparison reflects fuel improvements from 2.5% to 6.5% depending upon the steam load ramp regime. The simulations are performed using the SIMULINK® shell running under the MATLAB ® platform.","['Enrique Arriaga-De-Valle', 'Graciano Dieck-Assad']",50,['a5ef6be0-1e6e-4f9e-87a1-de2edefde16f'],Modeling and Simulation of a Fuzzy Supervisory Controller for an Industrial Boiler,Simulation,2006,4ae98b2a-6653-420a-856e-debcd4fc6bb5
"In-place flipping of rectangular blocks/cells can potentially reduce the wirelength of a floorplan/placement solution without changing the chip area, In a recent work [Hao 05], the flipping optimization is solved through a binary decision diagram (BDD) based approach. However, the BDD-based approach is not scalable for large SOC designs with many blocks due to memory and runtime blow-up. This paper presents a new approach using the partitioned ordered partial decision diagrams (POPDD) for wirelength minimization.

"Crop area extent estimates and crop type maps provide crucial information for agricultural monitoring and management. Remote sensing imagery in general and, more specifically, high temporal and high spatial resolution data as the ones which will be available with upcoming systems, such as Sentinel-2, constitute a major asset for this kind of application. The goal of this paper is to assess to what extent state-of-the-art supervised classification methods can be applied to high resolution multi-temporal optical imagery to produce accurate crop type maps at the global scale. Five concurrent strategies for automatic crop type map production have been selected and benchmarked using SPOT4 (Take5) and Landsat 8 data over 12 test sites spread all over the globe (four in Europe, four in Africa, two in America and two in Asia). This variety of tests sites allows one to draw conclusions applicable to a wide variety of landscapes and crop systems. The results show that a random forest classifier operating on linearly temporally gap-filled images can achieve overall accuracies above 80% for most sites. Only two sites showed low performances: Madagascar due to the presence of fields smaller than the pixel size and Burkina Faso due to a mix of trees and crops in the fields. The approach is based on supervised machine learning techniques, which need in situ data collection for the training step, but the map production is fully automatic.","['Jordi Inglada', 'Marcela Arias', 'Benjamin Tardy', 'Olivier Hagolle', 'Silvia Valero', 'David Morin', 'G.

"Nonlinear kernel Support Vector Machines achieve better generalizations, yet their training and evaluation speeds are prohibitively slow for real-time object detection tasks where the number of data points in training and the number of hypotheses to be tested in evaluation are in the order of millions. To accelerate the training and particularly testing of such nonlinear kernel machines, we map the input data onto a low-dimensional spectral (Fourier) feature space using a cosine transform, design a kernel that approximates the classification objective in a supervised setting, and apply a fast linear classifier instead of the conventional radial basis functions. We present a data driven hypotheses generation technique and a LogistBoost feature selection. Our experimental results demonstrate the computational improvements 20∼100× while maintaining a high classification accuracy in comparison to SVM linear and radial kernel basis function classifiers.","['Fatih Porikli', 'Huseyin Ozkan']",50,"['0e50559f-5494-4101-9fce-a59d28d1f084', '8bfb1563-5f31-4127-a98c-8d36c630fce8', 'a2f3690f-0bad-456c-9ab9-4f20bacec810', 'c671681a-2e91-4d53-8953-53c766668dba', 'c6aab6a4-d5ec-43b5-a2b3-9fa4af48a704', 'd9bed384-14fb-4766-8b03-228964eb70e7', 'dd83785a-dd19-41e3-9b25-ebabbd48d336', 'ff20f65e-6869-43b1-b0cf-a1da38fafb3a']",Data driven frequency mapping for computationally scalable object detection,advanced video and signal based surveillance,2011,4ae9b2be-62d3-4915-936b-47d0c2d66ba6

"The study of error-burst statistics is important for all detection systems, and more so for the decision feedback class. In data storage applications, many detection systems use decision feedback in one form or another. Fixed-delay tree search with decision feedback (FDTS/DF) and decision feedback equalization (DFE) are the direct forms, whereas the partial response detectors such as the reduced state sequence estimator (RSSE) and noise predictive maximum likelihood (NPML) detectors are the other forms. Although DF reduces the system complexity, it is inevitably linked with error propagation (EP), which can be quantified using error-burst statistics. Analytical evaluation of these statistics is difficult, if not impossible, because of the complexity of the problem. Hence, the usual practice is to use computer simulations. However, the computational time in traditional bit-by-bit simulations can be prohibitive at meaningful signal-to-noise ratios. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for fast estimation of error-burst statistics in FDTS/DF detectors, which is also applicable to other detection systems. In this approach, error events are initiated more frequently than natural by artificially injecting noise samples. These noise samples are generated using a transformation that results in significant reduction in computational complexity. Simulation studies show that the EP performance obtained by the proposed method matches closely with those obtained by bit-by-bit simulations, while saving as much as 99% of simulation time.","['Ming Jin', 'Behrouz Farhang-Boroujeny', 'George Mathew', 'Kalahasthi C.

"The proliferation of imprecise data has motivated both researchers and the database industry to push statistical techniques into relational database management systems (RDBMSes). We study strategies to maintain model-based views for a popular statistical technique, classification, inside an RDBMS in the presence of updates (to the set of training examples). We make three technical contributions: (1) A strategy that incrementally maintains classification inside an RDBMS. (2) An analysis of the above algorithm that shows that our algorithm is optimal among all deterministic algorithms (and asymptotically within a factor of 2 of a non-deterministic optimal strategy). (3) A novel hybrid-architecture based on the technical ideas that underlie the above algorithm which allows us to store only a fraction of the entities in memory.

"Hyperspectral imaging systems could be used for identifying the different soil types from the satellites. However, detecting the reflectance of the soils in all the wavelengths involves the use of a large number of sensors with high accuracy and also creates a problem in transmitting the data to earth stations for processing. The current sensors can reach a bandwidth of 20 nm and hence, the reflectance obtained using the sensors are the integration of reflectance obtained in each of the wavelength present in the spectral band. Moreover, not all spectral bands contribute equally to classification and hence, identifying the bands necessary to have a good classification is necessary to reduce sensor cost and problem in data transmission from the satellite. The work presents the spectral bands selected using a PCA-Based Forward Sequential band selection algorithm.","['Sivasathivel Kandasamy', 'Audrey Minghelli-Roman', 'Francois Tavin', 'Sandrine Mathieu', 'Frédéric Baret', 'Pierre Gouton']",0,"['7b729897-d7e8-449a-9ad3-b1fa78d217f2', '982fbb4c-db93-4786-bef0-974a0986abe9', '9941db18-659e-4113-b19c-531607d2873f', 'b77a6dcc-68e5-4c7d-bee0-84a041542f84']",Optimal band selection for future satellite sensor dedicated to soil science,,2009,4aea6bb1-cf31-490d-ae19-37337e320f78
"Attribute reduction is one of the challenging problems facing the effective application of computational intelligence technology for artificial intelligence. Its task is to eliminate dispensable attributes and search for a feature subset that possesses the same classification capacity as that of the original attribute set. To accomplish efficient attribute reduction, many heuristic search algorithms have been developed. Most of them are based on the model that the approximation of all the target concepts associated with a decision system is dividable into that of a single target concept represented by a pair of definable concepts known as lower and upper approximations. This paper proposes a novel model called macroscopic approximation, considering all the target concepts as an indivisible whole to be approximated by rough set boundary region derived from inconsistent tolerance blocks, as well as an efficient approximation framework called positive macroscopic approximation (PMA), addressing macroscopic approximations with respect to a series of attribute subsets. Based on PMA, a fast heuristic search algorithm for attribute reduction in incomplete decision systems is designed and achieves obviously better computational efficiency than other available algorithms, which is also demonstrated by the experimental results.","['Zhengcai Lu', 'Zheng Qin', 'Qiao Jing', 'L.

"Business trends require front-line managers to integrate multiproject concepts with those of traditional single-project management since very rarely can one find major organizations managing just one project. A typical situation entails a limited pool of resources which is applied to the management of several projects, with people moving back and forth among different assignments in different projects. Yet, few studies on project management have started to explore the issue of how to manage an organization with multiple inter- or intradepartmental projects. Using a case study method, our exploratory research investigates the specific problems associated with the management of multiple engineering projects in a manufacturing support environment, with the intent to identify common factors of success. Knowing the factors of success is but the first step toward improving multi-project management. Our findings provide insight into how the most important multiple-project success factors in this environment differ from factors of success in traditional single-project management, and are consistent with other emerging research in product development environments. The differences center on resource allocation and flexibility. Some factors, such as ownership, staff experience, and communication, take on additional dimensions when considered in a multiple-versus a single-project environment. Division and assignment of resources, prioritization, and customized management style, which have little relevance in relation to single projects, are shown to play a major role in the success of multiproject management.","['Scott E.

"The super-exponential algorithm is a block-based technique for blind channel equalization and system identification. Due to its fast convergence rate, and no a priori parameterization other than the block length, it is a useful tool for linear equalization of moderately distortive channels. This paper presents a recursive implementation of the super-exponential algorithm for fractionally-sampled PAM signals. Although the resulting algorithm is still block-based, recursive propagation of several key variables allows the block length to be significantly reduced without compromising the algorithm's accuracy or speed, thereby enhancing its ability to track channel variations. The convergence rate is only mildly influenced by specific channel responses, and oversampling provides smaller output variance and almost perfect tolerance to sampling errors. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.","['Joao Gomes', 'Victor Barroso']",50,"['2b9bfd47-b2ed-465a-aa6d-1e9f4584ff11', '3d7f5aa2-e9f0-46dc-a1c6-efbcfae619d1', '7c2acc77-b576-4614-95a3-8b690f5e785f']",Performance analysis of a recursive fractional super-exponential algorithm,international conference on acoustics speech and signal processing,1999,4aeaa1f5-87d9-4b92-8d60-290676b1923a

"A novel technique is introduced to locate and track the facial area in videophone-type sequences. The proposed method essentially consists of two components: (i) a color processing unit, and (ii) a knowledge-based shape and color analysis module. The color processing component utilizes the distribution of skin-tones in the HSV color space to obtain an initial set of candidate regions or objects. The second component in the segmentation scheme, that is, the shape and color analysis module is used to correctly identify and select the facial region in the case where more than one object has been extracted. A number of fuzzy membership functions are devised to provide information about each object’s shape, orientation, location and average hue. An aggregation operator finally combines these measures and correctly selects the facial area. The suggested approach is robust with regard to di⁄erent skin types, and various types of object or background motion within the scene. Furthermore, the algorithm can be implemented at a low computational complexity due to the binary nature of the operations involved.

"Unlike fixed combining rules, the trainable combiner is applicable to ensembles of diverse base classifier architectures with incomparable outputs. The trainable combiner, however, requires the additional step of deriving a second-stage training dataset from the base classifier outputs. Although several strategies have been devised, it is thus far unclear which is superior for a given situation. In this paper we investigate three principal training techniques, namely the re-use of the training dataset for both stages, an independent validation set, and the stacked generalization. On experiments with several datasets we have observed that the stacked generalization outperforms the other techniques in most situations, with the exception of very small sample sizes, in which the re-using strategy behaves better. We illustrate that the stacked generalization introduces additional noise to the second-stage training dataset, and should therefore be bundled with simple combiners that are insensitive to the noise. We propose an extension of the stacked generalization approach which significantly improves the combiner robustness.","['Pavel Paclík', 'Thomas C. W. Landgrebe', 'David M. J. Tax', 'Robert P. W.

"Service-Oriented Computing is a cornerstone for the realization of user needs through the automatic composition of services from service descriptions and user tasks, i.e., high-level descriptions of the user needs. Yet, automatic service composition processes commonly assume that service descriptions and user tasks share the same abstraction level, and that services have been pre-designed to integrate. To release these strong assumptions and to augment the possibilities of composition, we add adaptation features into the service composition process using semantic descriptions and adaptive extensions to graph planning.","['Sandrine Beauche', 'Pascal Poizat']",51,"['0f0996fa-8ca4-4bf1-b7af-8206fdaf09b2', '1ec36184-857a-4ac1-ad01-01ff209db531', '3ca217de-3903-4bda-9f88-d7269e71f9e7', '68cc8c53-3ac2-4ee4-afce-c7b4fad0e084', '7d927d81-9138-406d-9c2f-e85284ca009f', '81b2fc50-7db9-44c7-9d64-dd5974ffa0bd', '83f27530-48ba-427f-8553-f29647969785', 'fc04511c-b004-46fc-9217-90914293f547', 'ffd9c070-acd3-4d56-b6a8-012f23292f8b']",Automated Service Composition with Adaptive Planning,international conference on service oriented computing,2008,4aeae075-bed4-468a-9f10-79708d9cd488
We consider a packet switched wireless network in which a base station serves the mobiles. The packets for the mobiles arrive at the base station and have to be scheduled for transmission to the mobiles. The capacity of the channel from the base station to the mobiles is varying with time due to fading. We assume the mobiles can obtain different types of service based on the prices they are willing to pay. The objective of the base station is to schedule packets for transmission to mobiles to maximize the revenue earned. Our main result is that a simple greedy algorithm does at least 1/2 as good as the optimal offline algorithm that knows the complete future request pattern and channel conditions. We also show that no other online algorithm can do better.,"['Mohit Agarwal', 'Anuj Puri']",53,"['32ca176f-25dc-4ed9-ba3f-a6151b7b7afb', '384c4e75-1bde-4fb5-8460-a247821b456b', '476299d3-d23e-48ae-8ab6-fdb4a2973844', '66c490f1-f6c9-4742-b9a8-acd5ccc504af', '6f576030-7bfb-4b4d-931c-a981f3d5475e', '8d672617-dc8f-4125-b78b-96a8bfad6b5f', '977745c4-804e-424a-b093-b21fbd89757f', 'af3dcf0c-6e6f-4190-a9d6-9a9d2551e378', 'b4c405ef-2ca3-412a-b1ff-b4039da1e46a', 'de5f040c-6f2d-4249-9d72-2c0a4ebf4556', 'dfcedbb9-518a-40b1-8d5f-b80001152a0e']",Base station scheduling of requests with fixed deadlines,international conference on computer communications,2002,4aeaf361-52c7-4de3-b42c-8eeb54d02e48
"The SRI speaker recognition system for the 2010 NIST speaker recognition evaluation (SRE) incorporates multiple subsystems with a variety of features and modeling techniques. We describe our strategy for this year's evaluation, from the use of speech recognition and speech segmentation to the individual system descriptions as well as the final combination. Our results show that under most conditions, the cepstral systems tend to perform the best, but that other, non-cepstral systems have the most complementarity. The combination of several subsystems with the use of adequate side information gives a 35% improvement on the standard telephone condition. We also show that a constrained cepstral system based on nasal syllables tends to be more robust to vocal effort variabilities.","['Sachin S.

"This paper describes an interactive application that aims to support the rehabilitation of handwriting skills in people that suffer from paralysis after a stroke. The purpose of the application is to make the rehabilitation of handwriting skills fun and engaging. Four platform-independent games with adjustable levels of difficulty were created in order to target varying levels of skills. The application also features a performance history, audio-visual feedback, and posture reminders. It was evaluated with medical staff and patients from the Hoensbroeck Rehabilitation Centre in the Netherlands. The initial results indicated that the games are more motivating and fun than traditional pen and paper exercises. The feedback received from therapists supports our claim that the games are a useful addition to the rehabilitation of handwriting.","['Jennifer Curtis', 'Loes Ruijs', 'Maartje de Vries', 'Robert Winters', 'Jean-Bernard Martens']",5,"['2b495439-a3f1-4623-9af3-b600252b9c99', '77f91513-182a-426f-8442-d389255582fb']",Rehabilitation of handwriting skills in stroke patients using interactive games: a pilot study,human factors in computing systems,2009,4aeb0538-51ec-4501-a6b5-e60d23edc60e
"In this paper, a digital switching demodulator is presented for use in ac-based electrical capacitance tomography systems. Implementing a switching phase-sensitive demodulator (PSD) digitally offers the following advantages: 1) Demodulation can be implemented using a programmable digital device, and hence, CMOS switches, which are used in a conventional switching PSD, are no longer needed; 2) compared with the widely used digital quadrature PSD, this proposed demodulator is simple in configuration because neither a reference signal nor multiplication is required; 3) according to the specific requirements, the new demodulator can be implemented in two operation modes, i.e., the amplitude mode and the phase-sensitive mode; and 4) because only subtractions and accumulations are needed, the proposed demodulator can be easily implemented with low-cost logic devices, e.g., a complex programmable logic device (CPLD). By simulation, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed demodulator have been confirmed. CPLD-based and field-programmable-gate-array-based capacitance measurement circuits are constructed, and the performances of different demodulation methods are compared. Both simulation and experiment show that the proposed demodulator can provide demodulation results with high signal-to-noise ratio. The system design can be simplified using the digital switching demodulator.","['Lijun Xu', 'Haili Zhou', 'Zhang Cao', 'Wuqiang Yang']",50,"['7dadf3e4-3c55-4cd8-973d-2c6bd697549e', 'b1d26d91-5d59-489b-9f20-b6b53edf164a']",A Digital Switching Demodulator for Electrical Capacitance Tomography,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,2013,4aeb0eb9-ca5d-49fa-845f-cfb5662a0bee
"We present a novel psychophysical method for evaluating ultrasonography based on real-time tomographic reflection (RTTR), in comparison to conventional ultrasound (CUS). The method measures the user's perception of the location of an ultrasound-imaged target independently from assessing the action employed to reach it. Three experiments were conducted with the sonic flashlight (SF), an RTTR device, and CUS. The first two experiments determined subjects' perception of target location with a triangulation-by-pointing task. Depth perception with the SF was comparable to direct vision, while CUS caused considerable underestimation of target depth. Binocular depth information in the SF was shown to significantly contribute to its superiority. The third experiment tested subjects in an ultrasound-guided needle insertion task. Because the SF provides visualization of the target at its actual location, subjects performed insertions faster and more accurately by using the SF rather than CUS. Furthermore, the trajectory analysis showed that insertions with the SF generally went directly to the target along the desired path, while CUS often led to a large deviation from the correct path consistent with the observed underestimation of target depth. These findings lend great promise to the use of RTTR-based imaging in clinical practice and provide precise means of assessing efficacy.","['Bing Wu', 'Roberta L.

We present experimental results for the case study under several different scenarios and provide a detailed analysis, illustrating how this approach can be used to yield a better understanding of the dynamics of the pathway. Finally, we outline a number of exact and approximate techniques to enable the verification of larger and more complex pathways and apply several of them to the FGF case study.","['John K.

In order to do this, we recall the analogy between Markov Chains and electrical resistive networks. By exploiting this analogy, we are able to rewrite the performance cost as the average effective resistance on a suitable network. We use this result to show that if the communication graph fulfills some local properties, then its behavior can be approximated with that of a suitable grid, over which the behavior of the cost is known.","['Federica Garin', 'Enrico Lovisari', 'Sandro Zampieri']",50,"['7053ce03-9cca-4b1e-8473-179a0599fa98', '8c581627-0fe3-46cf-99cf-c5e3c9af272e', 'ec5cea52-381b-4263-ac39-5f59db9b0f91']",A resistance-based approach to consensus algorithm performance analysis,conference on decision and control,2010,4aeb4964-5f4e-4971-b67c-0452a38d605a

"Electromagnetic interference (EMI) regulations are a very important issue in the design of almost any electronic circuit. Over the years, “cut-and-try” procedures have been adopted by electronic designers to make circuits comply with these regulations, mainly due to the lack of reliable theoretical models of radiated noise and clear design rules. To gain new insight into this field, a novel approach is presented in this paper based on a well-known technique in the field of antenna design, i.e., the source reconstruction method (SRM). Its application allows a set of equivalent currents to be obtained that behave exactly like the circuit under consideration with regard to radiated noise. From these currents, magnetic and electric radiated fields can be obtained at any point in space, even at 3 or 10 m away from the circuit where the regulations must be met. Moreover, the equivalent currents accurately represent noise sources in the circuit, thus permitting the elements responsible for generating radiated noise to be located. The aforementioned method would enable designers to reduce the use of anechoic-chamber facilities when testing their designs, thereby leaving the chamber only for final certification purposes.","['Yuri Alvarez', 'Miguel Delgado Rodríguez', 'Fernando Las-Heras', 'Marta M.

"This paper considers a fading relay channel where the total transmit power used is constrained to be equal to that of the standard single-hop channel. The relay channel used operates in what is termed as MIMO cooperative diversity mode, where the source transmits to both relay and destination terminals in the first instance. Both the source and relay then transmit to the destination in the second instance. Initially the cooperative diversity framework is introduced to consider system constraints so a direct and fair comparison with the single-hop case can be made. In-particular a power constraint is placed on the system and the optimal transmit power levels are derived and presented. The derived technique for finding the optimal transmit power levels is then used to demonstrate the advantages of using cooperative diversity in a wireless network. The results presented show that MIMO cooperative diversity offers a 3.4 dB increase in spectral efficiency at 5 % outage, with no additional cost incurred in transmit time, power or bandwidth.","['A.

"Many interrelated planetary height map and surface image map data sets exist, and more data are collected each day. Broad communities of scientists require tools to compose these data interactively and explore them via real-time visualization. While related, these data sets are often unregistered with one another, having different projection, resolution, format, and type. We present a GPU-centric approach to the real-time composition and display of unregistered-but-related planetary-scale data. This approach employs a GPGPU process to tessellate spherical height fields. It uses a render-to-vertex-buffer technique to operate upon polygonal surface meshes in image space, allowing geometry processes to be expressed in terms of image processing. With height and surface map data processing unified in this fashion, a number of powerful composition operations may be uniformly applied to both. Examples include adaptation to nonuniform sampling due to projection, seamless blending of data of disparate resolution or transformation regardless of boundary, and the smooth interpolation of levels of detail in both geometry and imagery.

"A low-cost approach to concurrent detection of processor control errors is presented that uses a simple hardware monitor and signatures embedded into the executing program. Existing signature-monitoring techniques detect a large portion of processor control errors at a fraction of the cost of duplication. Analytical methods developed in this study show that the new approach, continuous signature monitoring (CSM), makes major advances beyond existing techniques. CSM reduces the fraction of undetected control-flow errors by orders of magnitude, to less than 10/sup -6/, while the number of signatures reaches a theoretical minimum, being lowered by as much as three times to a range of 4-11%. Signature cost is reduced by placing CSM signatures at locations that minimize performance loss and (for some architectures) memory overhead. CSM exploits the program memory's SEC/DED code to decrease error-detection latency by as much as 1000 times, to 0.016 program memory cycles, without increasing memory overhead. This short latency allows transient faults to be tolerated. >","['Kent D.

"Human hands employ characteristic patterns of actuation, or synergies, that contain much of the information required to describe an entire hand shape. In some cases, 80% or more of the total information can be described with only two scalar component values. Robotic hands, however, commonly only couple intra-finger joints, and rarely take advantage of this inter-finger coordination. In this paper, real-world data on a variety of human hand postures was collected using a data glove, and principal components analysis was used to calculate these synergies, resulting in what we call eigenpostures. A novel mechanism design is presented to combine the eigenpostures and drive a 17-degree-of-freedom 5-fingered robot hand. The hand uses only 2 DC motors to accurately recreate a wide range of hand shapes. We also present a design improvement that allows us to distinguish between high-precision and low-precision tasks, as well as greatly reduce overall error.","['Christopher Y. Brown', 'H.

"In this paper, we study the classical problem of object recognition in low-power, low-bandwidth distributed camera networks. The ability to perform robust object recognition is crucial for applications such as visual surveillance to track and identify objects of interest, and compensate visual nuisances such as occlusion and pose variation between multiple camera views. We propose an effective framework to perform distributed object recognition using a network of smart cameras and a computer as the base station. Due to the limited bandwidth between the cameras and the computer, the method utilizes the available computational power on the smart sensors to locally extract and compress SIFT-type image features to represent individual camera views. In particular, we show that between a network of cameras, high-dimensional SIFT histograms share a joint sparse pattern corresponding to a set of common features in 3-D. Such joint sparse patterns can be explicitly exploited to accurately encode the distributed signal via random projection, which is unsupervised and independent to the sensor modality. On the base station, we study multiple decoding schemes to simultaneously recover the multiple-view object features based on the distributed compressive sensing theory. The system has been implemented on the Berkeley CITRIC smart camera platform. The efficacy of the algorithm is validated through extensive simulation and experiments.","['Allen Y.

"The main advantages of SAR are the capability of imaging large areas in short time and delivering data at any day time and under nearly all weather conditions. This is especially important for disaster management and continuous long term monitoring applications. Key elements of man-made infrastructure are bridges. Especially for bridges over water, the SAR specific side looking imaging geometry can lead to special characteristics in the image. In this paper, the possibilities of extracting bridge features like width and height from SAR data, especially for bridges over water, are discussed. The feature extraction is based on the segmentation of parallel lines in an image. An approach is presented to exploit this feature extraction for change detection. The investigations are supported by SAR simulations, and real airborne and spaceborne data are presented.","['Erich Cadario', 'Hermann Gross', 'Horst Hammer', 'Karsten Schulz', 'Antje Thiele', 'Ulrich Thoennessen', 'Uwe Soergel', 'Dan Johan Weydahl']",50,"['2c38db86-ec0f-4f5c-a968-65100689e7ba', '2c5db0ae-1b98-4745-b47f-77d85cbaf96b', '2c87b5f9-58a1-441b-a292-50583af0b941', '36220e0d-23d1-43da-8e59-922e0f970353', '6d1aa5af-23b5-4a71-9518-8565a03398a1', '81f66cc7-4081-410a-a1ba-f95c96ae72c6', 'a379e1a9-7293-487b-bd31-e4a68423daae', 'ca1e2f6c-527a-4e4d-9971-cb8c6f32c354']",Change Detection for Bridges over Water in Airborne and Spaceborne SAR Data,international geoscience and remote sensing symposium,2008,4aec2f45-7f43-4595-b6f1-43238afd9017
"In this paper we present a variational method for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) speckle removal. Variational method is a newly developed technique for the removal of SAR's multiplicative noise. For an image, we could define an energy functional. The energy evolves as the original image changes, and the minimum energy corresponds to the speckle reduced result. Partial differential equation (PDE) technique is used to get the minimal solution. Our energy functional makes use of the statistical information of the multiplicative noise since it follows a Gamma law with mean mu = 1 and variance sigma 2  = 1/M for M-look SAR. Our energy is a regularization term with two constraints. The regularization term is the integral for the norm of image gradient; two constraints are the mean of noise should be 1 and the variance of noise should be 1/M. We use the method of Lagrange multipliers, Euler-Lagrange equation and heat flow method to obtain the minimizer of the energy. ERS Precision Image (PRI) data are to demonstrate our algorithm. Numerical result shows that the speckle reduced image preserves edges and point targets while smoothes homogenous regions in the original image. The algorithm is computationally efficient and easy to implement.","['Chaomin Shen', 'Yaxin Peng', 'Ling Pi', 'Zhibin Li']",50,['43898afd-2192-4aa3-9c66-1e4b02f2a392'],Variational-based speckle noise removal of SAR imagery,international geoscience and remote sensing symposium,2007,4aec30ad-45fb-4f1e-a1f1-f5a7cb022522

However, issues such as user-interface layouts, or the capture of interaction patterns, were not addressed by the profile, but only by the source-code generation process. This originated systems that, although functional, were considered by end-users as ""difficult to use"".

This profile follows the ""separation of concerns"" principle by proposing an integrated set of views that address the various issues detected with the previous version of XIS.

"We carry forward the work described in our previous papers [5,18,20] on the application of data independence to the model checking of security protocols using CSP [19] and FDR [10]. In particular, we showed how techniques based on data independence [12,19] could be used to justify, by means of a finite FDR check, systems where agents can perform an unbounded number of protocol runs. Whilst this allows for a more complete analysis, there was one significant incompleteness in the results we obtained: while each individual identity could perform an unlimited number of protocol runs sequentially, the degree of parallelism remained bounded (and small to avoid state space explosion). In this paper, we report significant progress towards the solution of this problem, by means anticipated in [5], namely by “internalising” protocol roles within the “intruder” process. The internalisation of protocol roles (initially only server-type roles) was introduced in [20] as a state-space reduction technique (for which it is usually spectacularly successful). It was quickly noticed that this had the beneficial side-effect of making the internalised server arbitrarily parallel, at least in cases where it did not generate any new values of data independent type. We now consider the case where internal roles do introduce fresh values and address the issue of capturing their state of mind (for the purposes of analysis).","['Philippa J. Broadfoot', 'A. W.

This paper examines the parallelization of the well known fast multipole based 3-D capacitance extraction program FASTCAP, which employs new preconditioning and adaptive techniques. To account for the complicated data dependencies in the unstructured problems, we propose a generalized cost function model, which can be used to accurately measure the workload associated with each cube in the hierarchy. We then present two adaptive partitioning schemes, combined with efficient communication mechanisms with bounded buffer size, to reduce the parallel processing overhead. The overall load balance is achieved through balancing the load at each level of the multipole computation. We report detailed performance results using a variety of standard benchmarks on 3-D capacitance extraction, on an IBM SP2.","['Yanhong Yuan', 'Prithviraj Banerjee']",50,"['2d2d0c92-9302-4e6c-bda1-0b3fc3b5a2f3', '7248dd71-f46e-4314-9b93-e6d98fe6056c', '896e55aa-c13a-4075-8a22-0c3f2f8c402e', 'b7bf9350-9375-408f-bd96-2fc970b6059b', 'cd3c6869-5298-4f08-876c-9cf01df327da', 'ebb27295-8825-4159-9fbe-6dcdfa1beb8b', 'fc50f485-529b-4779-957e-b8d432d8936b']",A parallel implementation of a fast multipole based 3-D capacitance extraction program on distributed memory multicomputers,international parallel and distributed processing symposium,2000,4aec7a22-095d-4966-ad43-a4df2c912dd6
"How to make vision system work robustly under dynamic light conditions is still a challenging research focus in computer/robot vision community. In this paper, a novel camera parameters auto-adjusting technique based on image entropy is proposed. Firstly image entropy is defined and its relationship with camera parameters is verified by experiments. Then how to optimize the camera parameters based on image entropy is proposed to make robot vision adaptive to the different light conditions. The algorithm is tested by using the omnidirectional vision in indoor RoboCup Middle Size League environment and the perspective camera in outdoor ordinary environment, and the results show that the method is effective and color constancy to some extent can be achieved.","['Huimin Lu', 'Hui Zhang', 'Shaowu Yang', 'Zhiqiang Zheng']",14,"['021c48fe-7713-456a-a5cc-dba584b4328b', '0598a8e1-a914-4243-bbed-faa95edc4b58', '096cce26-e135-45f7-8367-ce157da2077e', '1ea6ac96-5c23-40a0-bc6d-d658b3801439', '264dbf48-7d79-4d6d-a18e-48ee586d38ff', '684cdc13-cf1b-47e4-a59f-648abdf22f04', '823ec4f3-f834-4a5d-8b71-eb12456fe0bd', '8b09f953-fb2b-4c3f-92bf-f33d87a3ea9b', '92482818-ef5b-45f7-bfa3-cbe55d6155bf', '93378e13-0f38-429d-964b-abf990d6a37d', 'ae1defd9-f1cb-479f-a693-40285e8e2301', 'ae5eb783-4f1a-4bca-ac9e-0ede15ec65dc', 'd81cc480-7e94-4dc4-9cb8-a6f5daf90140']",Camera parameters auto-adjusting technique for robust robot vision,international conference on robotics and automation,2010,4aec9893-f1b9-474a-b8c6-d438d66a489e
"Considering the criminal uses of encryption, it has been asserted that national security and law enforcement endeavours must not be frustrated by potential evidence being hidden through digital encryption while the encryption key is withheld. The facilitation of state access to encryption keys through the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (‘RIPA 2000’) was intended to address precisely such a danger. However, since this statute’s enactment there have been significant shifts in law and policy relating to terrorism and child pornography as well as important technological developments. This article critically examines changes to the RIPA 2000 encryption provisions made by the Terrorism Act 2006 and the Policing and Crime Act 2009. It also considers emerging statistical data and cases including R v S(F) [2008]. It concludes that the underlying premises of the revised provisions are flawed, the provisions themselves ineffectual in practice and in the longer term potentially open to ‘mission creep’ to cover lesser offences.",['Bela Bonita Chatterjee'],0,,New but not improved : a critical examination of revisions to the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 encryption provisions,International Journal of Law and Information Technology,2011,4aeca613-4034-45d9-adcc-202d4273f56d

"The ubiquitous computing paradigm suggests that we are going to be surrounded by countless wireless devices capable of providing services trans- parently. By definition, the nature of ubiquitous computing environments is open and extremely dynamic, making difficult the establishment of predefined security relationships between all of the participating entities. Authentication mechanisms can be employed to establish the identity of a pervasive computing entity but they suffer from scalability problems and have limited value in defin- ing authorization decisions among strangers. In this paper we propose AETHER, an authorization management architecture designed specifically to address trust establishment and access control in ubiquitous computing environments. Own- ers define attribute authority sets and access control policy entries that are em- bedded into their devices. Members of the attribute authority sets are trusted to issue credentials for the corresponding attributes that can then be used in order to gain access to protected resources. Our architecture supports dynamic mem- bership in these sets facilitating distributed administration, which is required in the context of the volatile nature of ubiquitous security relationships, and at- tribute mapping to allow roaming among authority domains. Moreover, we pre- sent the foundation of a logic model for our proposed architecture that is used to prove access control decisions.","['Patroklos G.

"Semantic caching is a dynamic caching strategy which deals with not only exact but also inexact similar queries. In this manner, each query will be carefully analyzed by the cache manager to identify the part that can be found in the cache from the part that needs to be retrieved from the server. This trimming process not only speeds up information retrieval but also saves on communication cost especially for mobile and wireless devices. Therefore, query trimming is a key problem in mobile and wireless environment, and devices in this environment have limited connection time, bandwidth, and battery power. However, the existing methods for query trimming have a number of limitations such as, inefficiency in time, space and the complexity of the algorithm used for trimming. These factors restrict the applicability of semantic caching for many applications. In this paper we investigate the shortcomings of query trimming process and propose a new solution to improve this process.","['S.

"A common approach for generating an anisotropic mesh is the M-uniform mesh approach where an adaptive mesh is generated as a uniform one in the metric specified by a given tensor M. A key component is the determination of an appropriate metric, which is often based on some type of Hessian recovery. Recently, the use of a global hierarchical basis error estimator was proposed for the development of an anisotropic metric tensor for the adaptive finite element solution. This study discusses the use of this method for a selection of different applications. Numerical results show that the method performs well and is comparable with existing metric tensors based on Hessian recovery. Also, it can provide even better adaptation to the solution if applied to problems with gradient jumps and steep boundary layers. For the Poisson problem in a domain with a corner singularity, the new method provides meshes that are fully comparable to the theoretically optimal meshes.",['Lennard Kamenski'],50,"['1f1418b7-153b-4dec-9126-74653de9d150', '27cd4ab0-4b0f-40ee-ba0e-a9886765fe65', '3fdbc363-613a-4913-a496-780d7ce5e6ca', '71dd0de2-64f3-4ef9-8ea4-60c4eac5c218', '92c59056-7d65-4d01-ade3-b54668e05c01', '9889a0f4-7bac-4ebd-a5de-ad12be4d04ab', '9d33b011-dcff-4f48-9417-4377ce333328', 'a4442973-528a-4435-b3b8-c66bf4b7a15f', 'a80261d9-fc08-4eae-8ce8-313f733742da', 'ad93e09c-1d9b-4443-8100-8f0aa4bb0888', 'c297fc97-4368-45ff-8c99-1cc2db690c39', 'c4a38625-e7ac-477b-9234-d589ac3e3e2a']",A study on using hierarchical basis error estimates in anisotropic mesh adaptation for the finite element method,Engineering With Computers,2012,4aed6ac9-862c-4ef4-a247-a35f478930f1
"This paper describes our believable judge bot ICE-CIG2011 that has an ability to learn tactics from a judge player and an ability to judge an opponent character as a human or a bot. We conjecture that a bot with these two abilities should be considered human-like in a competition environment, such as BotPrize, where human players participate to compete not only for being the most human-like player but also the best judge. Main contributions of this work lie in our mechanisms for achieving these two abilities. To achieve the former ability, we develop a system and GUI that allow a selected judge player — whose role is to train ICE-CIG2011 — to control his or her character by only deciding which tactic to use under a given situation. We then obtain the judge's tactic log and use it for training tactic selection of ICE-CIG2011 with neuro evolution of augmenting topologies. To achieve the latter ability, we acquire additional logs when the judge character interacts with other opponent characters. In order to represent the play of a known (bot or human) character, we train a neural gas — a kind of self-organizing neural network — from its log. For an unknown character, once its neural gas is trained after a certain period of observation, ICE-CIG2011 decides if it is a human or bot by using the if-nearest-neighbor algorithm; this algorithm considers the majority in the labels of the if-nearest neural gases, of known characters, to the neural gas of that unknown character. Experimental results are given and discussed concerning these two abilities of ICE-CIG2011.","['Ruck Thawonmas', 'Seiji Murakami', 'Takumi Sato']",1,"['26299a7c-8b13-4805-870e-b872454da435', '2d4ccded-c923-49dd-9a38-cef8ecf75183', '5dda255f-8db7-44db-a971-48b52670359a', '8cdc389a-e12a-4b77-a1b9-b10ceda1e421', 'ac7d1981-ee89-4109-843c-8bf021d931f9', 'b976b5f9-6c27-4261-ae97-315139b19cc1', 'ec129d13-5f4b-403a-88ad-e749f0e6f2ed']",Believable judge bot that learns to select tactics and judge opponents,computational intelligence and games,2011,4aed7df9-5345-4f8b-96c5-907059d14285
"Previous research on static analysis for program families has focused on lifting analyses for single, plain programs to program families by employing idiosyncratic representations. The lifting effort typically involves a significant amount of work for proving the correctness of the lifted algorithm and demonstrating its scalability. In this paper, we propose a parameterized static analysis framework for program families that can automatically lift a class of type-based static analyses for plain programs to program families. The framework consists of a parametric logical specification and a parametric variational constraint solver. We prove that a lifted algorithm is correct provided that the underlying analysis algorithm is correct. An evaluation of our framework has revealed an error in a previous manually lifted analysis. Moreover, performance tests indicate that the overhead incurred by the general framework is bounded by a factor of 2.","['Sheng Chen', 'Martin Erwig']",50,"['10c94205-9930-4918-84e9-a9837dabccd7', '112eeff7-c265-4808-aef5-55f592540e40', '22c664d0-7858-4e2d-b46f-7d06a5ed0c10', '25692933-0d4f-4617-bf98-20aa547bb394', '399a2a91-7290-4649-b2a7-d1991540341f', '453be7f6-01f7-4344-bd3b-88985e688473', '46ed8cfc-9750-46a8-8492-e4702c5dfb1b', '561e6a59-ad01-4d0d-8227-67af2bd162af', '586116ee-992a-4bd4-89d9-44d98811c805', '58c1eead-71aa-4cbb-8197-9fff732fc871', '5d7b257a-148f-47b2-85b8-26559165df88', '679c34de-0d65-4f5e-a99c-80254daf3d2f', '737de1cf-5cf6-4496-87da-3523f4228eba', '73c92ba4-5820-4f65-a40e-846556f8ee5b', '79f9ecb6-5eb9-4a1f-a760-5209a5cc561c', '83cb0010-b854-4ca5-85c6-5e8619a1d4c9', '86235b4f-3001-4b3a-a810-551501ca366e', '91ffe261-839f-424d-9da1-fedefcf2a045', '948d35e9-c858-4daa-8c60-10c0c3a5c9fd', 'a6e2046a-9c0d-45dc-8781-5938d0ad41a0', 'add013f1-b12e-4b0a-be41-fe746f2e6037', 'b70e82b1-37c9-432a-af76-5996a86bb0fb', 'bd15774a-3e37-476a-8988-06bbb4726108', 'c31531f5-6d2b-4b6d-b145-2d24aa0127ed', 'cb6c94d4-bce4-4f9d-aea3-5b57a89fa322', 'ce43458e-cce7-4430-b68c-8c3d99db35b8', 'd03863f5-9e88-4d6f-901d-707673ff9ea2', 'd03d2843-91de-4ea1-9409-3f7b79205a3c', 'd1e73d36-106c-4498-ba57-6c4b9e734d8f', 'e26512b5-a6c0-4781-b3df-644a2181f21c', 'e2e62de3-82aa-40a1-8377-c191f3dc715c', 'e435c51c-247b-4386-8238-0f4d5d754eca', 'eed82e2a-6922-4dfb-9dde-18a54c79466f', 'f08cbffa-9467-4c74-a284-7db15837ac53', 'f72d3737-a87a-49e6-ad63-d3661b704af2', 'fc69e998-d19f-4d41-b99f-ef716125d08f']",Type-based parametric analysis of program families,international conference on functional programming,2014,4aeda4cf-468b-4c92-825c-63ec7c9ee301

"While spectral and temporal advantages of multitemporal hyperspectral images provide opportunities for advancing classification of time varying phenomena, significant challenges are associated with high dimensionality and nonstationary signatures. While manifold learning retains critical geometry and develops a low dimension space where class clusters are recovered, spectral changes in temporal imagery impact the fidelity of the geometric representation of class dependent data. In this paper, we investigate a manifold alignment framework that exploits prior information while exploring similar local structures. The aim is to make use of common underlying geometries of two multitemporal images and embed the resemblances in a joint data manifold for classification tasks. Promising results support the advantages of the proposed manifold alignment approach.","['Hsiuhan Lexie Yang', 'Melba M.

In this paper, we describe our design and application of a DSML in the area of data composition and interoperability. In particular, we introduce our recent effort to design a DSML to assist with interoperability issues across scientific software applications (e.g., composing scientific data in different file structures and integrating scientific data with data gathering devices). Currently, several different scientific data file specifications have been proposed (e.g., CID, netCDF, and HDF). Each file specification is optimized to manage a specific data type efficiently. Thus, each file specification has evolved with slightly different notions and implementation technologies. These differences led to the need for an environment that provides interoperability among the different specification formats.

"The two-temperature method (TTM) allows the separation of land-surface temperature and land-surface emissivity information from radiance measurements, and therefore, the solution can be uniquely determined by the data. However, the inverse problem is still an ill-posed problem, since the solution does not depend continuously on the data. Accordingly, we have used some mathematical tools, which are suited for analyses of ill-posed problems in order to show TTM properties, evaluate it, and optimize its estimations. Related to this last point, we have shown that it is necessary to constrain the problem, either by defining a region of physically admissible solutions and/or by using regularization methods, in order to obtain stable results. Besides, the results may be improved by using TTM with systems that possess a high temporal resolution, as well as by acquiring observations near the maximum and minimum of the diurnal temperature range.","['Leonardo F.

"Three-dimensional ICs promise to significantly extend the scale of system integration and facilitate new-generation electronics. However, progress in commercial 3D ICs has been slow. In addition to technology-related difficulties, industry experts cite the lack of a commercial 3D EDA tool-chain and design standards, high risk associated with a new technology, and high cost of transition from 2D to 3D ICs. To streamline the transition, we explore design styles that reuse existing 2D Intellectual Property (IP) blocks in 3D ICs. Currently, these design styles severely limit the placement of Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs) and constrain the reuse of existing 2D IP blocks in 3D ICs. To overcome this problem, we develop a methodology for using TSV islands and novel techniques for clustering nets to connect 2D IP blocks through TSV islands.

The bandwidth overhead associated with pilot symbols in conventional receiver architectures is eliminated while providing sufficient synchronization performance. An LDPC decoder coupled with our synchronizer exhibits negligible frame error rate degradation over a system with perfect synchronization.

"Multiband amplitude compression has been studied as a compensation for the reduced auditory dynamic range often associated with sensorineural hearing loss, since it is capable of altering the dynamic range of speech as a function of frequency. Compression systems are generally characterized by their response to steady state tones and to simple dynamic stimuli, such as tone bursts. Level distributions of unprocessed and compressed materials are presented to demonstrate that these descriptions are inadequate to predict the processing of speech.

"Three-dimensional (3D) movies in theaters have become a massive commercial success during recent years, and it is likely that, with the advancement of display technologies and the production of 3D contents, TV broadcasting in 3D will play an important role in home entertainments in the not too distant future. 3D video contents contain at least two views from different perspectives for the left and the right eye of viewers. The amount of coded information is doubled if these views are encoded separately. Moreover, for multi-view displays (i.e. different perspectives of a scene in 3D are presented to the viewer at the same time through different angles), either video streams of all the required views must be transmitted to the receiver, or the displays must synthesize the missing views with a subset of the views. The latter approach has been widely proposed to reduce the amount of data being transmitted. The virtual views can be synthesized by the Depth Image Based Rendering (DIBR) approach from textures and associated depth images. However it is still the case that the amount of information for the textures plus the depths presents a significant challenge for the network transmission capacity. An efficient compression will, therefore, increase the availability of content access and provide a better video quality under the same network capacity constraints.In this thesis, the compression of depth images is addressed. These depth images can be assumed as being piece-wise smooth. Starting from the properties of depth images, a novel depth image model based on edges and sparse samples is presented, which may also be utilized for depth image post-processing. Based on this model, a depth image coding scheme that explicitly encodes the locations of depth edges is proposed, and the coding scheme has a scalable structure. Furthermore, a compression scheme for block-based 3D-HEVC is also devised, in which diffusion is used for intra prediction. In addition to the proposed schemes, the thesis illustrates several evaluation methodologies, especially, the subjective test of the stimulus-comparison method. It is suitable for evaluating the quality of two impaired images, as the objective metrics are inaccurate with respect to synthesized views.The MPEG test sequences were used for the evaluation. The results showed that virtual views synthesized from post-processed depth images by using the proposed model are better than those synthesized from original depth images. More importantly, the proposed coding schemes using such a model produced better synthesized views than the state of the art schemes. As a result, the outcome of the thesis can lead to a better quality of 3DTV experience.","['Yun Li', 'Mårten Sjöström', 'Ulf Jennehag', 'Roger Olsson']",1,"['13bae019-b551-4d1f-a9ec-bf18fe5af0aa', '1f520d1a-5870-477d-85d7-0f50be690ea7', '382b9b52-83e6-4e41-991e-5a79d264ba11', 'da686df1-5164-4909-b23f-88da1cca93e2']",Depth image post-processing method by diffusion,Proceedings of SPIE,2013,4aeefe99-f054-45cc-8770-7be6729605b3
"Many forms of organizational memory must exist embedded within the organizational processes and tasks. This paper argues that ""memory-in-the small"", memory utilized in the performance of an organizational task, can serve as an effective performance support mechanism. By basing organizational memory upon organizational tasks (and basing task support upon organizational memory), organizational memory systems can provide additional and necessary support services for organizations and communities. As an example of memory-in-the-small, this paper describes a software application called the ASSIST, that combines organizational memory with task performance for a scientific community. The ASSIST utilizes and stores the collective memory of astrophysicists about data analysis and is used world-wide by astrophysicists. The paper also considers the theoretical and architectural issues involved when combining organizational memory with task performance. >","['Mark S.

"Computational RNA secondary structure prediction approaches differ by the way RNA pseudoknot interactions are handled. For reasons of computational efficiency, most approaches only allow a limited class of pseudoknot interactions or are not considering them at all. Here we present a computational method for RNA secondary structure prediction that is not restricted in terms of pseudoknot complexity. The approach is based on simulating a folding process in a coarse-grained manner by choosing helices based on established energy rules. The steric feasibility of the chosen set of helices is checked during the folding process using a highly coarse-grained 3D model of the RNA structures. Using two data sets of 26 and 241 RNA sequences we find that this approach is competitive compared to the existing RNA secondary structure prediction programs pknotsRG, HotKnots and UnaFold. The key advantages of the new method are that there is no algorithmic restriction in terms of pseudoknot complexity and a test is made for steric feasibility.

"This paper presents a complex systems overview of a power grid network. In recent years, concerns about the robustness of the power grid have grown because of several cascading outages in different parts of the world. In this paper, cascading effect has been simulated on three different networks, the IEEE 300 bus test system, the IEEE 118 bus test system, and the WSCC 179 bus equivalent model. Power Degradation has been discussed as a measure to estimate the damage to the network, in terms of load loss and node loss. A network generator has been developed to generate graphs with characteristics similar to the IEEE standard networks and the generated graphs are then compared with the standard networks to show the effect of topology in determining the robustness of a power grid. Three mitigation strategies, Homogeneous Load Reduction, Targeted Range-Based Load Reduction, and Use of Distributed Renewable Sources in combination with Islanding, have been suggested. The Homogeneous Load Reduction is the simplest to implement but the Targeted Range-Based Load Reduction is the most effective strategy.","['Sakshi Pahwa', 'Amelia Hodges', 'Caterina M.

"For the success of an SoC design, a design platform and some key design technologies are needed. For this purpose, a research project in ""Technology Development Program for Academia"" was granted recently in Taiwan to develop the following technologies toward a high-performance low-power SoC design platform. First, a soft intellectual property (soft IP) and related RTOS, compiler, and integrated design environment (IDE) software of an Advanced Taiwan VLTW DSP Processor Core, which can be used as the Star IP of an SoC design platform, will be developed. Second, low-power and low-voltage digital and mixed-signal circuit design technologies will be developed based on the advanced MTCMOS process. Third, some key multimedia and communication soft or hard IPs will be developed. The developed advanced key technologies can be used as the technology driver to facilitate the design of SoC-based products, and they will also help to enhance the design capability of the Taiwan SoC industry. In this paper, we introduce the research project and focus on architecture and software technologies developing in one of the subitems.","['Chih-Wen Hsueh', 'Tien-Fu Chen', 'Rong-Guey Chang', 'Shi-Wu Lo']",0,"['13736ae9-7918-46fa-b2e7-1379539e7049', 'f9ec9983-8b99-4f43-b57a-1256948a114b']",Development of architecture and software technologies in high-performance low-power SoC design,embedded and real-time computing systems and applications,2005,4aef8760-853b-4d13-8cd4-a1d2a42a2c0c

"Previous authors have identified mechanical, human and work organisation factors that may contribute to accident occurrences and have noted the value of site-specific data in accident analysis. However, major criticisms of site specific safety information systems have focused on the difficulties using traditional approaches for the identification of critical paths involving processes related to injury and non-injury incidents. This paper presents an idiographic approach to the study of accidents and through contextual analysis develops maps of work processes related to injury incidents in mining. The information used in the contextual maps includes data related to work area, activity and work role being performed, and equipment being used at the time of the injury incident. The computer algorithm consists of a series of contextual conditionals where the incidents and lost days recorded in the final category of each pathway meet all of the conditionals of the previous categories. The order of selection indicates the criticality of the path. The analysis resolves the processes related to the incident into their constitutive components, and then redescribes these processes as paths in order to reveal associations. These contextual paths illustrate the processes which are part of an established pattern of recurring regularities associated with injury incidents.","['David Brown', 'Andrea Kirk']",0,[],Using information systems to structurally map workplace injury,hawaii international conference on system sciences,2004,4aef9e2b-c30a-4ae8-8d88-e8d01ee03d5d
"It is possible to implement the parallel random access machine (PRAM) on a chip multiprocessor (CMP) efficiently with an emulated shared memory (ESM) architecture to gain easy parallel programmability crucial to wider penetration of CMPs to general purpose computing. This implementation relies on exploitation of the slack of parallel applications to hide the latency of the memory system instead of caches, sufficient bisection bandwidth to guarantee high throughput, and hashing to avoid hot spots in intercommunication. Unfortunately this solution can not handle workloads with low thread-level parallelism (TLP) efficiently because then there is not enough parallel slackness available for hiding the latency. In this paper we show that integrating nonuniform memory access (NUMA) support to the PRAM implementation architecture can solve this problem. The obtained PRAM-NUMA hybrid model is described and architectural implementation of it is outlined on our Eclipse ESM CMP framework.",['Martti Forsell'],50,"['20113058-8036-454b-9857-8a9751385b04', '28cb366d-6a2e-4c88-9515-70834e5c2b48', '40ed361a-59dd-4293-a149-85647493b118', '467c012d-0059-42c9-9685-1758066d26c9', '4fb5b716-dcd0-4a47-805a-62f8eb427b16', '89ce7f98-4710-4a90-91cb-a807b61953ae', 'a38a4576-f676-4fbb-a03e-f647fe6ecfc1', 'd372e0a9-4cbd-4159-89f8-22301fc1f30e']",A PRAM-NUMA model of computation for addressing low-TLP workloads,,2010,4aefb6c0-4a7a-40c8-834a-8d3c5af37a60

"We are designing new data mining techniques on boolean contexts to identify a priori interesting bi-sets (i.e., sets of objects or transactions associated to sets of attributes or items). A typical important case concerns formal concept mining (i.e., maximal rectangles of true values or associated closed sets by means of the so-called Galois connection). It has been applied with some success to, e.g., gene expression data analysis where objects denote biological situations and attributes denote gene expression properties. However in such real-life application domains, it turns out that the Galois association is a too strong one when considering intrinsically noisy data. It is clear that strong associations that would however accept a bounded number of exceptions would be extremely useful. We study the new pattern domain of α/β concepts, i.e., consistent maximal bi-sets with less than α false values per row and less than β false values per column. We provide a complete algorithm that computes all the α/β concepts based on the generation of concept unions pruned thanks to anti-monotonic constraints. An experimental validation on synthetic data is given. It illustrates that more relevant associations can be discovered in noisy data. We also discuss a practical application in molecular biology that illustrates an incomplete but quite useful extraction when all the concepts that are needed beforehand can not be discovered.","['Jérémy Besson', 'Céline Robardet', 'Jean-François Boulicaut']",28,"['209e01c3-c35d-4c33-a036-d5c982389067', '314ee2dd-a463-43b3-9225-9765cd991c36', '470c35c6-8a88-4528-8ec8-30555d80c93b', '5ded05d4-a19b-4f2a-a95c-7cbe9f751f65', '723165be-6207-4bcb-8b98-6dee09464e37', '730f2812-48ba-47ce-a85a-be2518c927a4', '87490909-5b0a-4b0d-bf88-3f485e33160a', '9591dff3-4bb7-4020-8db9-2a550fc63375', 'ae754516-b6ff-4ae7-a1a8-68c67ecc9755', 'c2520f9f-603c-4a64-b376-f3236c1947ae', 'c827cd53-9d2d-445c-9bfe-3571650ef718', 'ddbb6065-959e-42e2-967f-085a28b5b74d']",Mining formal concepts with a bounded number of exceptions from transactional data,,2004,4aeffba1-73f1-4bda-abe2-9222c548e045

"Certain gases in the breath are known to be indicators of the presence of diseases and clinical conditions. These gases have been identified as biomarkers using equipments, such as gas chromatography and electronic nose (e-nose). GC is very accurate but is expensive, time consuming, and nonportable. E-nose has the advantages of low cost and easy operation, but is not particular for analyzing breath odor, and hence, has a limited application in diseases diagnosis. This paper proposes a novel system that is special for breath analysis. We selected chemical sensors that are sensitive to the biomarkers and compositions in human breath, developed the system, and introduced the odor signal preprocessing and classification method. To evaluate the system performance, we captured breath samples from healthy persons and patients known to be afflicted with diabetes, renal disease, and airway inflammation, respectively, and conducted experiments on medical treatment evaluation and disease identification. The results show that the system is not only able to distinguish between breath samples from subjects suffering from various diseases or conditions (diabetes, renal disease, and airway inflammation) and breath samples from healthy subjects, but in the case of renal failure is also helpful in evaluating the efficacy of hemodialysis (treatment for renal failure).","['Dongmin Guo', 'David Zhang', 'Naimin Li', 'Lei Zhang', 'Jianhua Yang']",85,['da204d23-6096-4170-b4f7-db66366fc4b2'],A Novel Breath Analysis System Based on Electronic Olfaction,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,2010,4af00d38-e8a2-4f4c-a819-816772c52e0f
"The first purpose of this paper is to improve business processes in an industrial firm with business process modelling notation (BPMN) and business process execution language (BPEL). The second purpose is to provide a scientific approach for bringing business analysts and IT professionals together in a framework of an action research (AR). The research is conducted in one of the biggest distribution companies in Iran. BPMN is applied to model as-is and to-be situations of sale and distribution process. Both as-is and to-be models were simulated to compare their performance indexes. Moreover, models were implemented using BPEL, so that the model can be used for automating and improving the process. In this study, AR methodology was used to find a resolution of an organisational issue with those who experience this issue directly and to improve scientific knowledge and real-life contexts simultaneously.","['Abbas Keramati', 'Hamid Reza Golian', 'Masoud Afshari-Mofrad']",50,"['184f0d79-23a4-4a6f-9206-529ced7ee8f3', '39d80009-2e04-4651-89a8-73ea036da7ec', '3b725161-8932-49e5-abdf-ad5eab20aa5a', '3f08216c-6239-4f60-98ff-dd0540f399f8', '3f1f916d-3bcb-433b-8998-a4c37880169f', '588507f5-3658-4519-86c6-ea64da3fce29', '60277d80-b66e-473e-a3d1-42b89faf99b6', '93fd560e-f297-4939-abe1-e1829fb51e89', '9c0ece66-6283-4582-b2fa-77077ee44b9c', 'b65b4fb9-d9bd-4706-b094-de603029dcaa', 'c6a7a0df-e06c-4383-94c3-4b199d2fb761', 'dffa3328-ecf8-4ccb-a7f1-5b70c0e48625', 'e7f6c329-8454-4db4-943c-9c5e2d80a20e', 'f24c9d69-1f18-4fab-b114-141d1bdba32b']",Improving business processes with business process modelling notation and business process execution language: an action research approach,business information systems,2011,4af01344-3215-4875-8091-69c59217e16e

"Domain adaptation algorithms seek to generalize a model trained in a source domain to a new target domain. In many practical cases, the source and target distributions can differ substantially, and in some cases crucial target features may not have support in the source domain. In this paper we introduce an algorithm that bridges the gap between source and target domains by slowly adding to the training set both the target features and instances in which the current algorithm is the most confident. Our algorithm is a variant of co-training [7], and we name it CODA (Co-training for domain adaptation). Unlike the original co-training work, we do not assume a particular feature split. Instead, for each iteration of co-training, we formulate a single optimization problem which simultaneously learns a target predictor, a split of the feature space into views, and a subset of source and target features to include in the predictor. CODA significantly out-performs the state-of-the-art on the 12-domain benchmark data set of Blitzer et al. [4]. Indeed, over a wide range (65 of 84 comparisons) of target supervision CODA achieves the best performance.","['Minmin Chen', 'Kilian Q.

"Distributed computing systems provide a highly dynamic behavior which originates from heterogeneous computing and storage resources, heterogeneous users and the variety of submitted applications and finally from the heterogeneous communication that takes part among the systems entities. As such applying global optima oriented allocation algorithms usually produces poor results and heuristics are used instead. We concentrated our experiments around the Sufferage heuristic and its adaptive cluster-aware version XSufferage. Both Sufferage and XSufferage use a centralized design and produce good results for low levels of dynamism and deterministic environments. In real life distributed environments, both heuristics produce poor results. We expose the Sufferage heuristic through a distributed architecture based on a cooperative set of entities, which form a Multi-Agent System, such that the results could be improved. We implemented a new algorithm, based on this architecture, called Distributed XSufferage. In order to test the new algorithm, a series of experiments were developed by simulating two real life Grid environments. A complex set of performance metrics were collected -- flow time, make span, throughput -- both resource and cluster level, utilization -- both resource and cluster level and resources and clusters mean loads. Algorithms produce their allocation solution based on estimates and modeling of system's resources and as such are sensitive to estimation errors. Throughout our experiments DX Sufferage was more robust to such errors compared to the original Sufferage and, respectively, XSufferage heuristics.","['Alexandru Gherega', 'Valentin Pupezescu']",0,"['02a30d20-6a14-47b0-bf0f-c7d836bd4423', '40574de9-0285-4c49-80db-f84ba1ff5868', '9cb3eec7-8959-4024-81cb-14cf8a7a4b9d', 'a9b36b1c-7d4c-4af9-9a15-bfaa3e9b38c6', 'acf70684-920c-4823-842c-4e5a590cc03e', 'ad131ac6-5e4f-40bc-82ee-1d794b6ce92d', 'b26e61e0-8fd7-41b6-b83a-9e626920af05', 'bf21ffe2-8a75-4eea-a080-84da322a1724', 'fe91d7c9-e45e-4f94-b82c-3bf9ddeb2db4']",Multi-agent Resource Allocation Algorithm Based on the XSufferage Heuristic for Distributed Systems,symbolic and numeric algorithms for scientific computing,2011,4af04a4d-e071-4009-a19f-1c425dfd256f
"Hierarchical A* (HA*) uses of a hierarchy of coarse grammars to speed up parsing without sacrificing optimality.

We present Bridge Hierarchical A* (BHA*), a modified Hierarchial A* algorithm which computes a novel outside cost called a bridge outside cost. These bridge costs mix finer outside scores with coarser inside scores, and thus constitute tighter heuristics than entirely coarse scores.

"Program execution can be tampered with by malicious attackers through exploiting software vulnerabilities. Changing the program behavior by compromising control data and decision data has become the most serious threat in computer system security. Although several hardware approaches have been presented to validate program execution, they either incur great hardware overhead or introduce false alarms. We propose a new hardware-based approach by leveraging the existing speculative architectures for runtime program validation. The on-chip branch target buffer (BTB) is utilized as a cache of the legitimate control flow transfers stored in a secure memory region. In addition, the BTB is extended to store the correct program path information. At each indirect branch site, the BTB is used to validate the decision history of previous conditional branches and monitor the following execution path at runtime. Implementation of this approach is transparent to the upper operating system and programs. Thus, it is applicable to legacy code. Because of good code locality of the executable programs and effectiveness of branch prediction, the frequency of control-flow validations against the secure off-chip memory is low. Our experimental results show a negligible performance penalty and small storage overhead.","['Juan Carlos Martinez Santos', 'Yunsi Fei']",50,"['10f1002b-1eda-498e-a695-44f9394c31a9', '1cd271e4-f5f1-49a6-9a3b-ddd1c18cef86', '25b3b529-da12-492d-b8b5-9c525902fae4', '290e5f49-d04b-4a9c-b47e-3e8948dfa7c6', '2da2409d-6d3c-4c8b-9b44-bdb48081ed38', '4904b45c-7491-4698-843d-80a4177d6e1c', '5a9c8137-42a1-448e-8e59-6b90f95866af', '67e13773-4a7d-4dd9-a893-259d91877138', '68e18557-875a-4919-9d5b-1ebe275865cd', '6ce2a644-1c2e-45cb-8453-2c702e9fb06e', '6e0c72ba-776a-429e-bca1-b155043adacc', '711c6dd1-5ebd-4f13-b6b1-67a3585e8ce3', '7b0bf6b7-c285-438c-a022-0175b3de47a0', '7b6e52e2-5fb0-40a6-a8e8-056dc0a7e239', '7d38ede7-dc56-421f-8033-6db6b1237b56', '8f80ceae-9990-47fd-9936-7408ead7936a', '9e03f82a-7a63-4725-b660-21d3202d5c2b', 'a3ae983a-a5b1-4a66-85c4-f7eaba90def6', 'a4d28047-79be-4ab3-9b32-44f2e45b5ea2', 'ab76454c-9601-48ed-a273-c4d9d0ae52f0', 'ae8a51b9-e95f-41ab-bacf-7d98f5285009', 'aefd6f5d-c624-4751-a5ca-c1ba1f5a2a01', 'c6931fb7-aed9-42d3-bdac-25fa8a440b87', 'cbaa8709-74f4-4d23-a040-85380679e93e', 'cbabd757-881e-41a4-9f7e-4ad293355bd9', 'd0e876e5-00b6-4f98-b880-c4248b557173', 'df003009-2802-4a4d-98b4-fa583bfbd3df', 'e0e86bda-47ba-4b89-afd2-91dfe3255bb5', 'f2865a32-466e-4bc4-9d41-95f670b4ffb5']",Leveraging speculative architectures for runtime program validation,ACM Transactions in Embedded Computing Systems,2013,4af0cf0c-9028-47c5-aaeb-ac74372f4479
"A large number of cells will be deployed to provide high speed services in any places using the Long-Term Evolution (LTE) system. The management of such a large number of cells increases the operating expenditure (OPEX). Self-organizing networks (SON) attracted interest as an effective way to reduce OPEX. One of the main targets in SON is the self-optimization of handover (HO) that realizes mobility robustness. HO optimization algorithms adjust HO parameters between the serving and the reconnected cells based on the HO failure logs and cell selection, which is the procedure used to select a suitable reconnected cell, is very important for HO optimization algorithms. In this paper, we propose a cell selection scheme to enhance the performance of HO optimization. In the proposed scheme, both the uplink and downlink channel quality is considered when selecting a suitable reconnected cell. Through the computer simulation, we can see that the proposed scheme reduces the HO failure rate and the number of HO failures by 3 percentage points and 38%, respectively, compared to the conventional scheme based solely on downlink channel quality.","['Toshihiko Komine', 'Toshiaki Yamamoto', 'Satoshi Konishi']",2,"['1ddf6e7a-e65e-4a50-80c9-f49dafe845d3', '322a0fe0-8a8f-476c-9e86-59d23dec5d24', '54bcd9c7-0377-42dc-ae93-64f44e48eea2', '7f1749bd-cc10-4b1f-ba77-2c1b11642d89', '90f59048-da65-488a-a386-8336b8aa29b4', 'aebfed38-d345-40ac-aaf1-e2fb4d2ad48b']",A proposal of cell selection algorithm for LTE handover optimization,international symposium on computers and communications,2012,4af0dd48-dfdb-413d-ab13-c49bcdc65a04
"For a large-scale mesh network with dynamic traffic, maintaining the global state information in a centralized fashion is impractical. Hence, distributed schemes are needed to organize nodes and to manage state information in a more localized manner. One such effective scheme for organizing nodes is to cluster the nodes into a hierarchical structure. In this paper, we address the problem of determining the appropriate clustering of nodes for providing scalability in wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) optical networks with dynamic traffic. We present an on-line load-based (or bandwidth availability based) clustering technique that determines clusters adaptively in response to current network conditions. We also consider the problem of dynamic multicast on clustered networks with wavelength conversion capability. We introduce a heuristic using an auxiliary graph model to address routing, wavelength assignment, and traffic grooming jointly. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.","['Mohammad Masud Hasan', 'Jason P.

"Analyzing data to find trends, correlations, and stable patterns is an important problem for many industrial applications. We propose a new technique based on parallel coordinates visualization. Previous work on parallel coordinates method has shown that they are effective only when variables that are correlated and/or show similar patterns are displayed adjacently. Although current parallel coordinates tools allow the user to manually rearrange the order of variables, this process is very time-consuming when the number of variables is large. Automated assistance is needed. We propose an edit-distance based technique to rearrange variables so that interesting patterns can be easily detected. Our system, V-Miner, includes both automated methods for visualizing common patterns and a query tool that enables the user to describe specific target patterns to be mined/displayed by the system. Following an overview of the system, a case study is presented to explain how Motorola engineers have used V-Miner to identify significant patterns in their product test and design data.","['Kaidi Zhao', 'Bing Liu', 'Thomas M.

"This paper presents a simple procedure of obtaining a diversity gain in an antenna-array system with a short interelement separation, typically less than the carrier wavelength. The new technique provides a diversity gain through a noncoherent combination of received signals at each antenna element. The diversity gain arises because, as the number of signal components of the received signal at each antenna element becomes large enough and as the arrival angle of each signal component is distinct from one another, which is a general signal circumstance in most practical code division multiple access (CDMA) signal environments, the amplitudes of the received signals become nearly independent due to the phase difference among the received signals. The diversity gain was referred to as ldquophase diversityrdquo in this paper. The proposed technique is first theoretically analyzed to estimate the performance in terms of pseudorandom-noise-code acquisition, which is verified through extensive computer simulations. Then, through the experimental results that are obtained from a CDMA array-antenna base station system, it has been shown that the performance of noncoherent detection is proportionally improved to the number of antenna elements.","['Seungheon Hyeon', 'Yusuk Yun', 'Hyeongdong Kim', 'Seungwon Choi']",3,['291aa139-d037-4cd0-b668-8703dd7d370e'],Phase Diversity for an Antenna-Array System With a Short Interelement Separation,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2008,4af1049b-3f08-49ae-9b9d-2c44ce7cc76d

"Although users of high-performance computing are most interested in raw performance both energy and power consumption has become critical concerns. One approach to lowering energy and power is to use high-performance cluster nodes that have several power-performance states so that the energy-time trade-off can be dynamically adjusted. This paper analyzes the energy-time trade-off of a wide range of applications-serial and parallel-on a power-scalable cluster. We use a cluster of frequency and voltage-scalable AMD-64 nodes, each equipped with a power meter. We study the effects of memory and communication bottlenecks via direct measurement of time and energy. We also investigate metrics that can, at runtime, predict when each type of bottleneck occurs. Our results show that, for programs that have a memory or communication bottleneck, a power-scalable cluster can save significant energy with only a small time penalty. Furthermore, we find that, for some programs, it is possible to both consume less energy and execute in less time by increasing the number of nodes while reducing the frequency-voltage setting of each node","['Vincent W.

"Today's high performance computer systems must have fast, reliable access to memory and I/O devices. Unfortunately, inter-symbol interference, transmission line effects and other noise sources can distort data transfers. Engineers must therefore determine if bus designs have signal integrity  . e., the bus can transfer data with minimal amplitude or timing distortion. One method of determining signal quality on buses is to conduct a set of data transfers and measure various signal parameters at the receiver end. But the tests must be conducted with stressful test patterns that maximize inter-symbol interference to help identify any potential problems. In this paper we describe how an evolutionary algorithm was used to evolve such test patterns.

"A model for a binary additive noise communication channel with memory is introduced. The channel noise process, which is generated according to a ball sampling mechanism involving a queue of finite length M, is a stationary ergodic Mth-order Markov source. The channel properties are analyzed and several of its statistical and information-theoretical quantities (e.g., block transition distribution, autocorrelation function (ACF), capacity, and error exponent) are derived in either closed or easily computable form in terms of its four parameters. The capacity of the queue-based channel (QBC) is also analytically and numerically compared for a variety of channel conditions with the capacity of other binary models, such as the well-known Gilbert-Elliott channel (GEC), the Fritchman channel, and the finite-memory contagion channel. We also investigate the modeling of the traditional GEC using this QBC model. The QBC parameters are estimated by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence rate between the probability of noise sequences generated by the GEC and the QBC, while maintaining identical bit-error rates (BER) and correlation coefficients. The accuracy of fitting the GEC via the QBC is evaluated in terms of ACF, channel capacity, and error exponent. Numerical results indicate that the QBC provides a good approximation of the GEC for various channel conditions; it thus offers an interesting alternative to the GEC while remaining mathematically tractable.","['Libo Zhong', 'Fady Alajaji', 'Glen Takahara']",32,"['22360df6-03cc-4868-b6be-44414ae954b5', '403adc6b-0b72-42cd-9908-dadda8524a68', '68198b02-3da0-4565-a176-9d29195b4313', '687a0f6f-90e1-4a2d-b128-4d503daec4b7', '6e2fab7b-cb0d-4280-a635-524b356714fc', '75a93b77-b342-4889-b7a8-0105b8a5c8bc', '76c5a553-b273-4275-86de-6757d9cf4430', 'a0dff48b-85e6-425a-b61d-44aaf273cb1f', 'aa2e94b5-9842-4fa8-be5e-2a3414130740', 'abebe07a-bd16-4062-b0d1-beb190b05a8b', 'af40ffd5-70f3-40f7-a6c5-982814aa5491', 'e37407af-f783-4f67-9a95-2a0c41945b9d', 'f0e469e0-8ce0-499a-aa08-0e1009e2e9ae', 'f333d34b-ec20-4f76-9686-a8abef929f9e']",A Binary Communication Channel With Memory Based on a Finite Queue,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,2007,4af1acb5-2eae-4095-9af1-bc87df477cc1
"Triangular Irregular Network (TIN) and Regular Square Grid (RSG) are widely used for representing 2.5 dimensional spatial data. However, these models are not defined from the topographic properties of the terrain (i.e., ridge lines, valley lines, saddle points, etc.). This paper introduces a three-step feature-based approach for topographic properties extraction on scattered elevation data modeled by a TIN. Firstly, a segmentation process extracts homogeneous morphological areas bounded by critical lines and points. Secondly, these lines and points are displaced using a deformable process in order to derive the terrain feature points, lines and areas.

"Variable selection in high-dimensional space characterizes many contemporary problems in scientific discovery and decision making. Many frequently-used techniques are based on independence screening; examples include correlation ranking (Fan & Lv, 2008) or feature selection using a two-sample t-test in high-dimensional classification (Tibshirani et al., 2003). Within the context of the linear model, Fan & Lv (2008) showed that this simple correlation ranking possesses a sure independence screening property under certain conditions and that its revision, called iteratively sure independent screening (ISIS), is needed when the features are marginally unrelated but jointly related to the response variable. In this paper, we extend ISIS, without explicit definition of residuals, to a general pseudo-likelihood framework, which includes generalized linear models as a special case. Even in the least-squares setting, the new method improves ISIS by allowing feature deletion in the iterative process. Our technique allows us to select important features in high-dimensional classification where the popularly used two-sample t-method fails. A new technique is introduced to reduce the false selection rate in the feature screening stage. Several simulated and two real data examples are presented to illustrate the methodology.","['Jianqing Fan', 'Richard J.

"In recent years, spam mails intending for ``One-click fraud"" or ``Phishing"" have become increasing. As one anti-spam technology, DNSBL based on the URLs or their corresponding IP addresses in the messages is well used. However, some spam mails that cannot be filtered by conventional DNSBLs get appearing since the spammers create websites using various techniques such as botnet, fast-flux and Wildcard DNS record. To improve the accuracy of filtering spam mails using these techniques, we analyzed DNS record features corresponding to the domain name from the URLs in actual spam mails. According to the result of this analysis, we confirmed that abuse of Wildcard DNS record is one effective criterion for spam filtering.","['Shuji Suwa', 'Nariyoshi Yamai', 'Kiyohiko Okayama', 'Motonori Nakamura']",3,[],DNS Resource Record Analysis of URLs in E-Mail Messages for Improving Spam Filtering,symposium on applications and the internet,2011,4af1c87d-0df1-4cb5-9a4e-dfca7a31d95c
Transmission and storing of high density digital information plays an important role in the present age of information technology. These binary data are distorted while reading out of the recording medium or arriving at the receiver end due to inter symbol interference in the channel. The adaptive channel equalizer alleviates this distortion and reconstructs the transmitted data faithfully. The bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) is a recently developed efficient and derivative free evolutionary computing tool used for optimization purpose. In the present paper we propose a novel nonlinear channel equalizer using BFO algorithm. The recovery performance of the new equalizer is obtained through computer simulation study using nonlinear channels. It is shown that the proposed equalizer offers superior performance both in terms of bit-error-rate and convergence speed compared to the GA based equalizers. In addition it requires substantially less computation during training.,"['Babita Majhi', 'Ganapati Panda']",50,"['519e684a-0336-4d44-a1bd-69419aac63a7', '51ce8b3a-92bb-4ee2-acc4-91b2439dc6f2', '6edd2d45-18d5-4569-a234-8cb99df1666f', '80f4b07a-3c74-451d-a791-1eedac4657d6', 'c046e8a4-8619-42dc-b07b-a70c4c963881']",Recovery of Digital Information Using Bacterial Foraging Optimization Based Nonlinear Channel Equalizers,international conference on digital information management,2007,4af1cdb4-2744-4e84-bf96-8ef02a495daa
"Several private information retrieval (PIR) schemes were proposed to protect users' privacy when sensitive information stored in database servers is retrieved. However, existing PIR schemes assume that any attack to the servers does not change the information stored and any computational results. We present a novel fault-tolerant PIR scheme (called FT-PIR) that protects users' privacy and at the same time ensures service availability in the presence of malicious server faults. Our scheme neither relies on any unproven cryptographic assumptions nor the availability of tamper-proof hardware. A probabilistic verification function is introduced into the scheme to detect corrupted results. Unlike previous PIR research that attempted mainly to demonstrate the theoretical feasibility of PIR, we have actually implemented both a PIR scheme and our FT-PIR scheme in a distributed database environment. The experimental and analytical results show that only modest performance overhead is introduced by FT-PIR while comparing with PIR in the fault-free cases. The FT-PIR scheme tolerates a variety of server faults effectively. In certain fail-stop fault scenarios, FT-PIR performs even better than PIR. It was observed that 35.82% less processing time was actually needed for FT-PIR to tolerate one server fault.","['Erica Y. Yang', 'Jie Xu', 'Keith H.

This paper discusses the use of a 77 GHz millimeter wave radar as a guidance sensor for autonomous land vehicle navigation. A test vehicle has been fitted with a radar and encoders that give steer angle and velocity. An extended Kalman filter optimally fuses the radar range and bearing measurements with vehicle control signals to give estimated position and variance as the vehicle moves around a test site. The effectiveness of this data fusion is compared with encoders alone and with a satellite positioning system. Consecutive scans have been combined to give a radar image of the surrounding environment. Data in this format are invaluable for future work on collision detection and map building navigation.,"['Steve Clark', 'Hugh F.

"Analytic shrinkage is a statistical technique that offers a fast alternative to cross-validation for the regularization of covariance matrices and has appealing consistency properties. We show that the proof of consistency requires bounds on the growth rates of eigenvalues and their dispersion, which are often violated in data. We prove consistency under assumptions which do not restrict the covariance structure and therefore better match real world data. In addition, we propose an extension of analytic shrinkage -orthogonal complement shrinkage- which adapts to the covariance structure. Finally we demonstrate the superior performance of our novel approach on data from the domains of finance, spoken letter and optical character recognition, and neuroscience.","['Daniel Bartz', 'Klaus Robert Müller']",16,['10ebbda8-d881-4c11-9d71-a7448d3b384e'],Generalizing Analytic Shrinkage for Arbitrary Covariance Structures,neural information processing systems,2013,4af24cb3-6fd0-445d-98ab-a9bab60afc75

"The sun is a convenient and frequently employed external radiation source for calibrating weather radar antenna and receiver characteristics. However, changes in solar activity can be a major source of error in interpreting the results of solar calibration for lower frequency bands. The cross-correlation of horizontal and vertical polarization signals, which is zero for perfectly unpolarized electromagnetic radiation, could give non-zero estimates if a quiet sun is not observed by the radar. In this paper, solar scan measurements are made at X-band to detect the effect of solar activity on this cross-correlation coefficient. To facilitate mitigation of instrument-wide errors, we employ multiple XPOL radars to simultaneously observe the sun. Though our experiments during a limited period show that the cross-channel correlation estimates obtained by X-band weather radars remain relatively unaffected by the variations in solar flux, the paper makes suggestions on improving the results.","['Kumar Vijay Mishra', 'Anton Kruger', 'Witold F.

"Dyreson and Snodgrass have drawn attention to the fact that, in many temporal database applications, there is often uncertainty about the start time of events, the end time of events, and the duration of events.  When the granularity of time is small (e.g., milliseconds), a statement such as “Packet  p  was shipped sometime during the first 5 days of January, 1998” leads to a massive amount of uncertainty (5×24×60×60×1000) possibilities.  As noted in Zaniolo et al. [1997], past attempts to deal with uncertainty in databases have been restricted to relatively small amounts of uncertainty in attributes.  Dyreson and Snodgrass have taken an important first step towards solving this problem.  In this article, we first introduce the   syntax of Temporal-Probabilistic (TP) relations and then show how they can be converted to an explicit, significantly more space-consuming form, called Annotated Relations.  We then present a  theoretical annotated temporal algebra  (TATA).  Being explicit, TATA is convenient for specifying how the algebraic operations should behave, but is impractical to use because annotated relations are overwhelmingly large.  Next, we present a  temporal probabilistic algebra  (TPA).  We show that our definition of the TP-algebra provides a correct implementation of TATA despite the fact that it operates on implicit, succinct TP-relations instead of overwhemingly large annotated relations. Finally, we report on timings for an implementation of the TP-Algebra built on   top of ODBC.","['Alex Dekhtyar', 'Robert B. Ross', 'V. S.

"Displacement estimated interframe (DEI) coding, a coding scheme for 3-D medical image data sets such as X-ray computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) images, is presented. To take advantage of the correlation between contiguous slices, a displacement-compensated difference image based on the previous image is encoded. The best fitting distribution functions for the discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients obtained from displacement compensated difference images are determined and used in allocating bits and optimizing quantizers for the coefficients. The DEI scheme is compared with 2-D block discrete cosine transform (DCT) as well as a full-frame DCT using the bit allocation technique of S. Lo and H.K. Huang (1985). For X-ray CT head images, the present bit allocation and quantizer design, using an appropriate distribution model, resulted in a 13-dB improvement in the SNR compared to the full-frame DCT using the bit allocation technique. For an image set with 5-mm slice thickness, the DEI method gave about 5% improvement in the compression ratio on average and less blockiness at the same distortion. The performance gain increases to about 10% when the slice thickness decreases to 3 mm. >","['Heesub Lee', 'Yongmin Kim', 'Alan H. Rowberg', 'Eve A.

"In this paper, we present a new approach to improving the performance of a writer identification system by fusing asynchronous feature streams. Different feature streams are extracted from on-line handwritten text acquired from a whiteboard. The feature streams are used to train a text and language independent writer identification system based on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). From a stroke consisting of n points, n point-based feature vectors and one stroke-based feature vector are extracted. The resulting feature streams thus have an unequal number of feature vectors. We evaluate different methods to directly fuse the feature streams and show that, by means of feature fusion, we can improve the performance of the writer identification system on a data set produced by 200 different writers.","['Andreas Schlapbach', 'Horst Bunke']",50,"['11f3a6b6-a992-42db-b42f-981c945cd38b', '1b47b7a4-e32e-4e30-a9d3-b83c7798edfa', '530e1ee8-d9c2-4e7b-b0f1-5a0a5eb3b5e3', '6bf64780-0638-4de7-8946-d07ec7e90515', '75200711-930b-408f-8a50-fc6dbd7c1fab', '88654e63-a2b0-485c-9a07-e55c1fe6bc98', '8a384b45-66c8-4341-9cbf-bfe757a18af4', '8abf7aa8-e3e6-4e48-90d4-b97bf745fc67', '97cf7f10-646e-48d0-b408-c7339aa514fc', 'b445a971-767c-4e33-b0a1-957638a564e6', 'be1732c4-ebbf-47d9-88f0-cb12d9377cc2', 'd130ecec-e5cf-4f59-b4f8-1cbda4b0c307']",Fusing Asynchronous Feature Streams for On-line Writer Identification,international conference on document analysis and recognition,2007,4af31ef0-2d15-48ac-a4f7-8ed259b6fd70
"Being an important and yet a challenging problem, the QoS-based routing in the converging Internet has received significant attention from the research community. However, most of the QoS-based routing research is conducted in the context of intra-domain routing, leaving QoS-based inter-domain routing relatively open. In this paper, we specifically investigate how to extend the current inter-domain routing protocol (BGP) to support multiple QoS metrics. With multiple metrics, a BGP speaker has to advertise multiple routes for each destination to its peer. This will increase the routing message overhead and make QoS-aware BGP unscalable to large networks. Therefore, our focus in this paper is to bring QoS extensions to the original BGP while simultaneously providing high performance and scalability. In response to this, we propose path reduction algorithms, i.e., Contribution Based Reduction (CBR) algorithms, to reduce the number of routes advertised by BGP speakers while maximizing the routing success ratio. Extensive simulations show that our schemes achieve high performance with low complexity in terms of message overhead and computation, making the QoS extension to BGP scalable.","['Tielei Zhang', 'Yong Cui', 'Youjian Zhao', 'Lizheng Fu', 'Turgay Korkmaz']",50,"['0a73835d-7549-4e1e-b1d5-9d69a414f686', '221a51ba-b64d-4bf4-b9b9-968b9d7bd99e', '637d2ffe-b3d5-4315-8a10-d6dd45442283', 'a37b724b-7422-4a3f-9b6c-555436685c20', 'b1b55c0a-14f4-40e4-8a7a-8a0ecec2cef5']",Scalable BGP QoS Extension with Multiple Metrics,international conference on networking and services,2006,4af33c22-417c-4695-8b32-cb40768264c0
"Background: Systems biology approaches to study metabolic switching in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) depend on cultivation conditions ensuring high reproducibility and distinct phases of culture growth and secondary metabolite production. In addition, biomass concentrations must be sufficiently high to allow for extensive time-series sampling before occurrence of a given nutrient depletion for transition triggering. The present study describes for the first time the development of a dedicated optimized submerged batch fermentation strategy as the basis for highly time-resolved systems biology studies of metabolic switching in S. coelicolor A3(2). Results: By a step-wise approach, cultivation conditions and two fully defined cultivation media were developed and evaluated using strain M145 of S. coelicolor A3(2), providing a high degree of cultivation reproducibility and enabling reliable studies of the effect of phosphate depletion and L-glutamate depletion on the metabolic transition to antibiotic production phase. Interestingly, both of the two carbon sources provided, D-glucose and L-glutamate, were found to be necessary in order to maintain high growth rates and prevent secondary metabolite production before nutrient depletion. Comparative analysis of batch cultivations with (i) both L-glutamate and D-glucose in excess, (ii) L-glutamate depletion and D-glucose in excess, (iii) L-glutamate as the sole source of carbon and (iv) D-glucose as the sole source of carbon, reveal a complex interplay of the two carbon sources in the bacterium's central carbon metabolism. Conclusions: The present study presents for the first time a dedicated cultivation strategy fulfilling the requirements for systems biology studies of metabolic switching in S. coelicolor A3(2). Key results from labelling and cultivation experiments on either or both of the two carbon sources provided indicate that in the presence of D-glucose, L-glutamate was the preferred carbon source, while D-glucose alone appeared incapable of maintaining culture growth, likely due to a metabolic bottleneck at the oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA.","['Alexander Wentzel', 'Per Bruheim', 'Anders Øverby', 'Øyvind M.

"We describe a linear-time algorithm that recovers absolute camera positions for networks of thousands of terrestrial images spanning hundreds of meters in outdoor urban scenes, under uncontrolled lighting. The algorithm requires no human input or interaction. For real data, it recovers camera pose globally consistent on average to roughly five centimeters, or about four pixels of epipolar alignment. The paper's principal contributions include an extension of Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation techniques to the case of unknown numbers of feature points, unknown occlusion and deocclusion, large scale (thousands of images, and hundreds of thousands of point features), and large dimensional extent (tens of meters of inter-camera baseline, and hundreds of meters of baseline overall). Also, a principled method is given to manage uncertainty on the sphere; a new use of the Hough transform is proposed; and a method for aggregating local baseline constraints into a globally consistent pose set is described.","['Matthew E.

"Performance of overlay networks is dependent on last-mile connections, since they require that data traverse these last-mile bottlenecks at each forwarding step. This requires several times more upstream bandwidth than downstream, further exaggerating the asymmetry between down-stream and upstream bandwidth in last-mile technologies. This imbalance can cause packet queuing at the outgoing network interface of forwarding nodes, increasing latency and causing packet losses. We describe a model of a last-mile constrained overlay network and formulate and use it to solve a simplified latency- and bandwidth-bounded overlay construction problem. We observe that queueing delay may be a significant component of the end-to-end delay and approaches ignoring this may potentially result in an overlay network violating the delay and/or loss bounds. We observe that allowing a small amount of loss, it is possible to support a significantly large number of nodes. For a given end to end delay and loss bound we identify feasible degree (fan out) of each nodes. Our study sheds insights which provide engineering guidelines for designing overlays accounting for last mile problem in the Internet.","['Parijat Dube', 'Zhen Liu', 'Sambit Sahu', 'Jeremy I.

"This paper introduces a novel forecasting algorithm that is a blend of micro and macro modelling perspectives when using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. The micro component concerns the fine-tuning of technical indicators with population based optimization algorithms. This entails learning a set of parameters that optimize some economically desirable fitness function as to create a dynamic signal processor which adapts to changing market environments. The macro component concerns combining the heterogeneous set of signals produced from a population of optimized technical indicators. The combined signal is derived from a Learning Classifier System (LCS) framework that combines population based optimization and reinforcement learning (RL). This research is motivated by two factors, that of non-stationarity and cyclical profitability (as implied by the adaptive market hypothesis [10]). These two properties are not necessarily in contradiction but they do highlight the need for adaptation and creation of new models, while synchronously being able to consult others which were previously effective. The results demonstrate that the proposed system is effective at combining the signals into a coherent profitable trading system but that the performance of the system is bounded by the quality of the solutions in the population.","['Matthew Butler', 'Dimitar Kazakov']",50,"['22465d62-1117-4cd0-87c8-9ab6643be6a1', '31a786d1-755c-45d7-b0e4-b59cd92eb313', 'a1016c84-8cf0-4271-aaa5-5752a2dcccee', 'a4eabbf3-58cd-4646-ad79-08aa7eec2bd2', 'c00cefce-20e0-4992-ac17-c69bf8c56a93', 'c64b3179-3b95-4067-a6de-c251c54962f9']",A learning adaptive Bollinger band system,,2012,4af395b9-7154-4af3-989f-13230b57a078

"Multilevel dynamic random-access memory (MLDRAM) attempts to increase the storage density of semiconductor memory without further reducing the lithographic dimensions. It does so by using more than two possible signal voltages on each cell capacitor thus permitting more than one bit to be stored in each cell. Birk's MLDRAM scheme has several promising properties, including robust locally-generated data signal and reference signal generation, and fast flash-conversion sensing. This paper describes a fault model for Birk's MLDRAM that was developed by considering the behaviors produced by likely defects at the schematic level. The resulting behaviors include faults that are detectable as observable logical errors, faults that can be detected by current measurements, and faults that, in the worst case, can only be detected by testing for degraded noise margins. All Boolean faults in the fault model can be detected by an efficient test whose length grows linearly in the number of cells. The narrower noise margins in MLDRAM will make it more vulnerable to pattern sensitivities. We also developed a linear test that evaluates worst-case sensing conditions.","['Michael Redeker', 'Bruce F. Cockburn', 'Duncan G.

Given an application power-state machine (PSM), we first identify the suitable range of supply voltages for each core. Then, we generate the discrete voltage assignment table using a heuristic technique. Next, we describe a methodology of reducing the large number of available choices from the voltage assignment table down to a useful set using the application PSM. We partition the cores into islands, using a cost function that gradually shifts from a power-based assignment to a connectivity-based one. Compared with previously reported techniques, a 9.4% reduction in power and 8.7% reduction in area are achieved using our approach, with an average runtime improvement of 2.4 times.","['Dipanjan Sengupta', 'Resve Saleh']",50,"['08603428-e3b6-45b3-8b4c-e58c06ab8711', '0885af5d-630e-4909-9c86-bbb46cacbfdc', '197e1140-8213-4b7d-baf4-2c97e3349cfe', '1ea4070d-e44e-4f6f-9e7f-a6f36e746fb8', '23cf9cbe-a96d-467d-8077-04da14a75abe', '2b276369-505e-4115-88c5-ae4e0f8c88ac', '46bbae93-7f56-40f4-9349-528b8eaab214', '4b614a8a-b023-4957-a09b-8861f2b215e0', '5619678e-75a2-4acf-9ce2-f5f27b219969', '60629177-c363-44c9-b903-4668a28ff564', '63075b7e-2ce7-45c2-a130-b4eb28edd78d', '63e30a35-7f7d-4f2d-a866-46ddfb938dcb', '644050aa-635f-4283-a3b9-92bc9365abc4', '6f9262bf-5d58-42ac-abe7-1ac6f06ba924', '804115d4-0231-4688-a73e-6a25d014f0ea', '83a7807b-f696-45e3-8e77-e9326fd0928b', '8ca2332d-22d5-4b29-9a59-f56212badb5c', '92a288b5-600d-4205-8b8f-034763ad7d8a', '98d981a3-6550-497c-bf8f-fa14be4b29cc', '9a6a0c6c-cf1a-4d0b-b9b0-b21a2515e75a', '9c2d6bf5-981a-43a0-be2b-e36614c7fa35', 'a1a71fae-1be0-448f-8b2e-045f87b1526c', 'aa1668cb-b31f-4b23-a1ff-59e98b7ea043', 'b13e2f56-3df8-438b-bb2d-a27148b197fb', 'b2bbea1d-62d4-4ad0-a308-1c4093a98cf4', 'caae0bd5-6197-4b8b-81bc-4a6415bc1a7b', 'ccda402a-95b3-4932-b4a0-c26ac090ac4d', 'd468c90b-cca0-43d5-9f6d-a54b29a3369e', 'd7785741-4957-4569-b5ad-b8e2d72e87e4', 'dc8f92c5-2ac0-4318-91a5-bf3856c6a31b', 'e656ec3c-309d-4496-8712-59c55b8d65c2', 'ebf574fd-3c95-4730-9395-5a7958a6e6f1', 'f09ac1ad-7915-407e-b9de-34389b6b1bf2', 'f4ac5a0c-d395-4d23-af9a-f4b226bd4c74']",Application-Driven Voltage-Island Partitioning for Low-Power System-on-Chip Design,IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems,2009,4af41b00-274e-4838-bfdb-be9aae322b4c
"Complex queries are becoming commonplace, with the growing use of decision support systems. Decision support queries often have a lot of common sub-expressions within each query, and queries are often run as a batch. Multi query optimization aims at exploiting common sub-expressions, to reduce the evaluation cost of queries, by computing them once and then caching them for future use, both within individual queries and across queries in a batch. In case cache space is limited, the total size of sub-expressions that are worth caching may exceed available cache space. Prior work in multi query optimization involves choosing a set of common sub-expressions that fit in available cache space, and once computed, retaining their results across the execution of all queries in a batch. Such optimization algorithms do not consider the possibility of dynamically changing the cache contents. This may lead to sub-expressions occupying cache space even if they are not used by subsequent queries. The available cache space can be best utilized by evaluating the queries in an appropriate order and changing the cache contents as queries are executed. We present several algorithms that consider these factors, in order to reduce the cost of query evaluation.","['Amit Gupta', 'S.

"Motivation: Many genomes have been completely sequenced. However, detecting and analyzing their protein--protein interactions by experimental methods such as co-immunoprecipitation, tandem affinity purification and Y2H is not as fast as genome sequencing. Therefore, a computational prediction method based on the known protein structural interactions will be useful to analyze large-scale protein--protein interaction rules within and among complete genomes.#R##N##R##N#Results: We confirmed that all the predicted protein family interactomes (the full set of protein family interactions within a proteome) of 146 species are scale-free networks, and they share a small core network comprising 36 protein families related to indispensable cellular functions. We found two fundamental differences among prokaryotic and eukaryotic interactomes: (1) eukarya had significantly more hub families than archaea and bacteria and (2) certain special hub families determined the topology of the eukaryotic interactomes. Our comparative analysis suggests that a very small number of expansive protein families led to the evolution of interactomes and seemed tohave played a key role in species diversification.#R##N##R##N#Contact: jong@kribb.re.kr#R##N##R##N#Supplementary information: http://interactomics.org","['Daeui Park', 'Semin Lee', 'Dan M.

"This talk presents results of a case study from a course called ""History of Games"" offered at the School of Art + Design at New Jersey Institute of Technology. After analyzing various traditional board games and their mechanics, students explore the possibility of producing their own original board games by altering various existing game structures through application of new technologies such as digital prototyping, including laser cutting and 3-D printing, and microcontroller technologies. In principle, we can fully emulate the playing of a board game such as Monopoly inside a computer, digitally. However, there is a certain quality of physicality with traditional board games that cannot be experienced through games in fully digital environments. The existence of tangible game pieces, boards, and real human players can produce cooperation, engagement, and tensions unlike those in video games and AR-based applications.

"Traffic congestion has become a daily problem that most people suffer. This not only impacts the productivity of the population but also poses a safety risk. Most of the technologies for intelligent highways focus on safety measures and increased driver awareness, and expect a centralized management for the traffic flow. This paper presents a new approach for enabling autonomous and adaptive traffic management through vehicular networks. By allowing data exchange between vehicles about route choices, congestions and traffic alerts, a vehicle makes a decision on the best course of action. Unlike centralized schemes that provide recommendations, our VANET-based Autonomous Management (VAM) approach factors in the destination and routes of nearby vehicles in deciding on whether rerouting is advisable. In addition, VAM leverages the presence of smart traffic lights and enables coordination between vehicles and lightcontrollers in order to ease congestion. The collective effect of all vehicles will be an autonomous reshape of the traffic pattern based on their destinations and road conditions. The simulation results demonstrate the advantage of VAM.","['Sanket Gupte', 'Mohamed F.

"Cloud gaming has recently been proposed as an alternative to traditional video game distribution. With this approach, the entire game is stored, run and rendered on a remote server. Player input is forwarded to the server via the Internet and the game's output is returned as a video stream. This adds network delay, which can negatively impact the gameplay. The delay is acceptable as long as the user is located geographically close to the cloud servers. However, for Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs), this delay is added on top of the existing delay between MMOG client and server. As MMOGs are highly delay-sensitive, this can significantly degrade their playability. To deal with this issue, we propose to use peer-to-peer techniques to distribute the MMOG server functionality and place it at the cloud server centers. This allows us to reduce the additional delay introduced by running the MMOG clients in the cloud.","['Richard Suselbeck', 'Gregor Schiele', 'Christian Becker']",50,['423a917f-2ff3-405f-8bc7-85068f869e3b'],Peer-to-peer support for low-latency Massively Multiplayer Online Games in the cloud,network and system support for games,2009,4af55e9a-f391-4f40-abfc-a3f90f345b5c
"The rapid deployment of smartphones as all-purpose mobile computing systems has led to a wide adoption of wireless communication systems such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in mobile scenarios. Both communication systems leak information to the surroundings during operation. This information has been used for tracking and crowd density estimations in literature. However, an estimation of pedestrian flows has not yet been evaluated with respect to a known ground truth and, thus, a reliable adoption in real world scenarios is rather difficult. With this paper, we fill in this gap. Using ground truth provided by the security check process at a major German airport, we discuss the quality and feasibility of pedestrian flow estimations for both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth captures. We present and evaluate three approaches in order to improve the accuracy in comparison to a naive count of captured MAC addresses. Such counts only showed an impractical Pearson correlation of 0.53 for Bluetooth and 0.61 for Wi-Fi compared to ground truth. The presented extended approaches yield a superior correlation of 0.75 in best case. This indicates a strong correlation and an improvement of accuracy. Given these results, the presented approaches allow for a practical estimation of pedestrian flows.","['Lorenz Schauer', 'Martin Werner', 'Philipp Marcus']",50,"['0e48cd79-5cd4-428a-950a-b48cab585f01', '3de894a3-cb52-412b-904b-f1b373dc7386', '57f9ce04-d33f-4731-a90c-3e48188ee7bc', '5f34eef1-79dd-479d-a2c9-cd61f8b0ade9', 'a2f18dd4-f838-4766-b8c8-6fc3ae01b8c0', 'a6913e56-039d-4ccb-a4f3-b4b84c38cc62', 'bde77e5e-2578-4087-83b5-32ee8ac7f0d3', 'bf120c68-3c06-4a22-843f-dadb33e9ab75', 'bf862027-a8d1-483d-bc7b-9ebb8a56f059', 'd2f12655-bd10-4232-9f11-5722cf8362cd', 'e4bd888a-d2d5-4c43-82ff-0110e7b9b113']",Estimating crowd densities and pedestrian flows using wi-fi and bluetooth,international conference on mobile and ubiquitous systems: networking and services,2014,4af57ad0-79cb-44f1-9221-40c7e9ed45da
"Analysts often rely on methods that presume constant stochastic variance, even though its degree can differ markedly across experimental and field settings. This reliance can lead to misestimation of effect sizes or unjustified theoretical or behavioral inferences. Classic utility-based discrete-choice theory makes sharp, testable predictions about how observed choice patterns should change when stochastic variance differs across items, brands, or conditions. We derive and examine the implications of assuming constant stochastic variance for choices made under different conditions or at different times, in particular, whether substantive effects can arise purely as artifacts. These implications are tested via an experiment designed to isolate the effects of stochastic variation in choice behavior. Results strongly suggest that the stochastic component should be carefully modeled to differ across both available brands and temporal conditions, and that its variance may be relatively greater for choices made for the future. The experimental design controls for several alternative mechanisms (e.g., flexibility seeking), and a series of related models suggest that several econometrically detectable explanations like correlated error, state dependence, and variety seeking add no explanatory power. A series of simulations argues for appropriate flexibility in discrete-choice specification when attempting to detect temporal stochastic inflation effects.","['Linda Court Salisbury', 'Fred M.

"Sensor network nodes have a very tight power budget and the power efficiency is the biggest design concern in sensor network circuits. A general-purpose processor (e.g. an ARM processor) is not efficient to execute encryption algorithms because it has no special instructions to support encryption operations, for example very often-used permutation operations. In the paper, we propose a low-power ASIC encryption coprocessor for sensor network nodes. A DES algorithm is used because the algorithm does not include power-hungry and complex mathematic operations, such as multiplication, division and addition. An asynchronous logic style is used to design the coprocessor. With an asynchronous controller, a global clock is not necessary when idle, resulting in zero standby dynamic power. Using the DES coprocessor, the power consumed by encryption can be saved by 4 orders of magnitude than a pure software calculation.","['Yijun Liu', 'Pinghua Chen', 'Guobo Xie', 'Zhusong Liu', 'Zhenkun Li']",50,"['b43b3471-e778-4fbd-8498-7553501c330c', 'd9154445-dd71-4815-8918-812ea39dbaaa']",The Design of a Low-Power Asynchronous DES Coprocessor for Sensor Network Encryption,,2008,4af5dca7-131d-48f5-998f-eec70b8d5334
"Engineering ethics education is taking on increasing importance worldwide, but in Chile the percentage of universities that have a mandatory course concerning ethics is still small. Traditionally, Chilean universities with existing ethics courses teach them using a philosophical or theological perspective, limited to occidental theories, and usually from a Christian point of view. This article studies the impact of a new methodology and technique to teach ethics in Chile: case-based, non-normative, and with a critical-descriptive approach. An empirical study is conducted to assess the relative impact of an ethics class on students individual and inherent moral values and attitudes, and understand the factors that contribute to this impact. Results indicate that even though the importance of religion in Chile is decreasing, it is still a major source of students� ethical principles and moral values. In addition, results suggest that a change in moral values develops when discussions among groups with different points of view occur.","['Ruth I. Murrugarra', 'William A.

"The paper presents an alternative approach to the formal specification and validation of distributed asynchronous algorithms. It begins with a syntactically correct description of the algorithm whose correctness is then to be validated. The validation of the algorithm is based on the process-oriented discrete simulation and permits a partial correctness validation of the algorithm implemented by a program. The suggested method enables to model independent activity of several processors (using pseudo-parallel processes) in simulation time and to model communication channels with defined time behavior and failure semantics. Using the approach it is easy to add other processes like model of system's environment, fault injector and state observer. The method is described with the aid of a simple C-based validation tool called C-Sim. The utilization of C-Sim requires only slight changes in C-coded implementation of the verified algorithm. An example of validation of distributed election algorithm with the presence of faults is presented.","['Jan Hlavicka', 'Stanislav Racek', 'Pavel Šmrha']",4,"['592fb1f5-fd5b-4da8-a807-6f29a5241c5d', '9e8508e0-d510-4e88-ad7d-3aa9d55a2961', 'a3815ace-3ba2-4c24-b84d-8053b567549c']",Functional validation of fault-tolerant asynchronous algorithms,,1996,4af5fd86-8dd1-43e2-a91a-cb6fa42c3f29
"Social media is being increasingly used as a communication channel. Among social media, web forums, where people in online communities disseminate and receive information by interaction, provide a good environment to examine information diffusion. In this research, we aim to understand the mechanisms and properties of the information diffusion in the web forum. For that, we model topic-level information diffusion in web forums using the baseline epidemic model, the SIR(Susceptible, Infective, and Recovered) model, frequently used in previous research to analyze disease outbreaks and knowledge diffusion. In addition, we propose an event-driven SIR model that reflects the event effect on information diffusion in the web forum. The proposed model incorporates the effect of news postings on the web forum. We evaluate two models using a large longitudinal dataset from the web forum of a major company. The event-SIR model outperforms the SIR model in fitting on major spikey topics that have peaks of author participation.","['Jiyoung Woo', 'Hsinchun Chen']",7,"['2131b26d-48b9-4414-83a1-506e48eacadd', '34d6513f-5438-41d8-b481-071b749cd7bc', '3c0c7536-7f11-4e63-bf6d-32d67050d8ef', '3d11074d-a91c-4dba-bbca-2797badbc00a', '443476c2-a280-4817-99a9-ff8783b33970', '45e2bdd0-847c-4490-b859-47418f874dde', '4a9ef5d8-83dd-4f6d-b557-3cccc8eeec27', '642960b5-d3f1-4f41-9178-834004225378', '6c67d8c3-3450-4dbc-8ce7-269d39337b67', '700fe5e3-36d0-47a5-b35f-8b0419086576', '7e6ce434-1093-4620-9eb6-a41e5af37467', '84480766-1d30-464b-a269-8bb2d96372f3', '9e805495-6ad2-49a4-a0fc-0c4d649173b3', 'b70aceae-1391-4813-8e5b-ac32074c3c39']",An event-driven SIR model for topic diffusion in web forums,intelligence and security informatics,2012,4af61c46-0e90-4847-b051-e8da77e65f4a
A robust method for finding points of intersection of line segments in a 2-D plane is presented. The plane is subdivided by Delaunay triangulation to localize areas where points of intersection exist and to guarantee the topological consistency of the resulting arrangement. The subdivision is refined by inserting midpoints recursively until the areas containing points of intersection are sufficiently localized. The method is robust in the sense that it does not miss points of intersection that are easily detectable when costly line-pair checking is performed. The algorithm is adaptive in the sense that most of the computational cost is incurred for the areas where finding points of intersection is difficult. >,['Kokichi Sugihara'],50,"['745e644b-b7ad-4ef2-b9b0-879506923349', '8486a374-a56d-4b48-b0d4-6e132c0593b3', '8a67998e-3c69-42fb-b519-47f9430011c8']",An intersection algorithm based on Delaunay triangulation,IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications,1992,4af61d54-3db5-46aa-bd67-7b77e3dd5a26

The authors derive lower bounds and the corresponding optimal protocols for three parameters for synchronous primary-backup systems. They compare their results with similar results for active replication in order to determine whether the common folklore on the virtues of the two approaches can be shown formally. They also extend some of their results to asynchronous primary-backup systems. They implement an important subclass of primary-backup protocols that they call 0-blocking. These protocols are interesting because they introduce no additional protocol related delay into a failure-free service request. Through implementing these protocols the authors hope to determine the appropriateness of their theoretical system model and uncover other practical advantages or limitations of the primary-backup approach. >,"['Navin Budhiraja', 'Keith Marzullo']",71,"['53a65fd7-2077-4e5c-b39c-8db99bb41481', '6b2818f1-e878-45fb-995f-68bf60645a3f', '7683a759-5e97-4eb3-a5a9-644907ac1e75', '8b495c61-ea6e-4c7b-9b45-3121ab994aa8', 'bdce9352-60ec-42d8-b4f0-e6a6a620cbba', 'ec452cf7-daa7-468a-81b3-5f69af655cb3', 'f1b8a32b-2629-476b-a0fe-07bd782d141c', 'fd3cef1e-5035-45ea-9acc-99d65a5ef860']",Highly-available services using the primary-backup approach,,1992,4af632da-c295-4a72-a894-0092e88e4141

"A new approach called Percolation Based Synthesis for the scheduling phase of High Level Synthesis (HLS) is presented. We discuss some new techniques (which are implemented in our tools) for compaction of flow graphs beyond basic blocks limits, which can produce order of magnitude speed ups versus serial execution. Our algorithm applies to programs with  conditional jumps, loops  and  multicycle pipelined operations . In order to schedule under resource constraints we start by first finding the  optimal schedule  (without constraints) and then add heuristics to map the optimal schedule onto the given system. We argue that starting from an optimal schedule is one of the most important factors in scheduling because it offers the user flexibility to tune the heuristics and gives him a good bound for the resource constrained schedule. This scheduling algorithm is integrated with synthesis tool which uses VHDL as input description and produces a  structural netlist  of generic register-transfer components and a  unit based control table  as output. We show that our algorithm obtains better results than previously published algorithms.","['Roni Potasman', 'Joseph Lis', 'Alexandru Nicolau', 'Daniel D.

"Specification and Description Language (SDL) is a high abstraction level system design language with a clear graphical notation. Because of formal presentation, an SDL model can be automatically converted into source C code for implementation. However, the high abstraction level creates a conceptual gap between a general SDL model and its implementation in a final operational platform. The paper studies the SDL development of an embedded Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol for a wireless local area network (WLAN) demonstrator. The SDL design flow for the protocol is first started by architectural design without target platform dependencies. Functionality is added to the model using the top-down design approach. Functional simulations are used for verifying the operation of the protocol. Next, the performance is estimated using performance simulations in a workstation environment. Performance improvements can be achieved by optimising the SDL model.","['Marko Hännikäinen', 'J. Knuutila', 'Timo D. Hämäläinen', 'J.

"All I know is that I know nothing (Socratic Ignorance). The world is an increasingly complex with problems that require swift resolution. Although knowledge is widely available, be it stored in companies’ databases or spread over the Internet, humans have intrinsic limitations for handling very large volumes of information or keeping track of frequent updates in a constantly changing world. Moreover, human reasoning is highly intuitive and potentially biased. Decision-making is often based on rules of thumb instead of systematic analysis with full understanding of decisions’ context. Computer systems that manage knowledge to thoroughly explore the context and the range of alternatives may improve human decision-making by making people aware of possible misconceptions and biases. Computer systems are also limited in their potential usage due to the frame problem. Systems are not aware of their ignorance, thus they cannot surplus human intelligence, but they may be useful complement to human’s intelligence. The objective of this paper is to present the AGUIA model for amplifying human intelligence, based on agent’s technology, for task-oriented contexts. AGUIA uses domain ontology and task scripts for handling formal and semiformal knowledge bases, thereby helping to systematically (1) explore the range of alternatives, (2) interpret the problem and the context, and (3) maintain “awareness” of the problem. As for humans, knowledge is a fundamental resource for AGUIA performance. AGUIA’s knowledge base keeps updating its content, in the background, during interaction with humans, either through identified individuals or through anonymous mass contribution. The feasibility and benefits of AGUIA were demonstrated in many different fields, such as engineering design, fault diagnosis, accident investigation and online interaction with the government. The experiments considered a set of criteria including: product cost, number of explored alternatives, users’ problem understanding and users’ awareness of problem context changes. Results indicate AGUIA can actually improve human problem solving capacity in many different areas.","['Ana Cristina', 'Bicharra Garcia']",50,"['11146993-e86d-4790-931c-3921506b9e0b', '1dafe571-674f-458e-8663-4d4501d05e16', '3a5c8795-2e91-46d0-b240-b49f565f8a3d', '426de03d-8bfb-4970-ac19-f43908f83ee0', '5aec50d3-998e-43f8-a1cb-dab540876a16', '6ab5beaf-234a-48dd-b8ae-5ed052cd64c4', '773b9ace-c72b-42e7-9376-b82e2404e797', '822235e6-6abe-442b-b761-b51795df418a', '8674bf6a-9ce4-4a1b-87fa-e43a1d4f47a9', '98801e79-fc9d-4c6a-a383-10e937c9d008', 'a12e5675-e7b5-47b5-8bc6-499832021c6c', 'a98c1103-a08f-48d5-a03c-9a09970a9f5c', 'b82a831d-20af-4088-86c3-443752add44b', 'be3fe51b-fc4b-495e-acf7-aac90705aa95', 'e10762f4-d9ec-4a6d-92e6-54b606eede73', 'f55a7917-f1d7-4f5a-ab4a-c62d84f00cd5']",AGUIA: Agents Guidance for Intelligence Amplification in Goal Oriented Tasks,,2010,4af6763d-fae0-45a6-beb7-5f416221126a

"The ultimate goal of computer design is to satisfy the end-user. In particular computing domains, such as interactive applications, there exists a variation in user expectations and user satisfaction relative to the performance of existing computer systems. In this work, we leverage this variation to develop more efficient architectures that are customized to end-users. We first investigate the relationship between microarchitectural parameters and user satisfaction. Specifically, we analyze the relationship between hardware performance counter (HPC) readings and individual satisfaction levels reported by users for representative applications. Our results show that the satisfaction of the user is strongly correlated to the performance of the underlying hardware. More importantly, the results show that user satisfaction is highly user-dependent. To take advantage of these observations, we develop a framework called Individualized Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (iDVFS). We study a group of users to characterize the relationship between the HPCs and individual user satisfaction levels. Based on this analysis, we use artificial neural networks to model the function from HPCs to user satisfaction for individual users. This model is then used online to predict user satisfaction and set the frequency level accordingly. A second set of user studies demonstrates that iDVFS reduces the CPU power consumption by over 25% in representative applications as compared to the Windows XP DVFS algorithm.","['Alex Shye', 'Berkin Özisikyilmaz', 'Arindam Mallik', 'Gokhan Memik', 'Peter A.

"The worldwide concern about the gender gap in information technology and the lack of woman participation in computer science has been attributed to the different cultural influences to which boys and girls are subject. In The University of Hong Kong, girls achieved greater improvements in their computer skills than their male counterparts after completing one year of studies. Recognising their own progress has, in turn, boosted their confidence in using IT. The young women's estimates of their skill levels have doubled over the years from 1998 to 2000. Despite this recorded acceleration at the end of the academic years, girls were less confident of their abilities and possessed lower IT skill levels than boys before starting their university education, as found in surveys of freshmen's computer skills.

"Motivation: Flux balance analysis (FBA) is a well-known technique for genome-scale modeling of metabolic flux. Typically, an FBA formulation requires the accurate specification of four sets: biochemical reactions, biomass metabolites, nutrients and secreted metabolites. The development of FBA models can be time consuming and tedious because of the difficulty in assembling completely accurate descriptions of these sets, and in identifying errors in the composition of these sets. For example, the presence of a single non-producible metabolite in the biomass will make the entire model infeasible. Other difficulties in FBA modeling are that model distributions, and predicted fluxes, can be cryptic and difficult to understand.#R##N##R##N#Results: We present a multiple gap-filling method to accelerate the development of FBA models using a new tool, called MetaFlux, based on mixed integer linear programming (MILP). The method suggests corrections to the sets of reactions, biomass metabolites, nutrients and secretions. The method generates FBA models directly from Pathway/Genome Databases. Thus, FBA models developed in this framework are easily queried and visualized using the Pathway Tools software. Predicted fluxes are more easily comprehended by visualizing them on diagrams of individual metabolic pathways or of metabolic maps.

"Customer management activities at firms involve making consistent decisions over time, about: a which customers to select for targeting, b determining the level of resources to be allocated to the selected customers, and c selecting customers to be nurtured to increase future profitability. Measurement of customer profitability and a deep understanding of the link between firm actions and customer profitability are critical for ensuring the success of the above decisions. We present the case study of how IBM used customer lifetime value CLV as an indicator of customer profitability and allocated marketing resources based on CLV. CLV was used as a criterion for determining the level of marketing contacts through direct mail, telesales, e-mail, and catalogs for each customer. In a pilot study implemented for about 35,000 customers, this approach led to reallocation of resources for about 14% of the customers as compared to the allocation rules used previously which were based on past spending history. The CLV-based resource reallocation led to an increase in revenue of about $20 million a tenfold increase without any changes in the level of marketing investment. Overall, the successful implementation of the CLV-based approach resulted in increased productivity from marketing investments. We also discuss the organizational and implementation challenges that surrounded the adoption of CLV in this firm.","['Vikas Kumar', 'Rajkumar Venkatesan', 'Tim Bohling', 'Denise Beckmann']",130,[],Practice Prize Report---The Power of CLV: Managing Customer Lifetime Value at IBM,Marketing Science,2008,4af7597b-d5e5-4c93-86ae-2e76831ef1ed
"Uplink multi-user direct sequence-code division multi-access (DS-CDMA) suffers from strong multi-user interference (MUI) and self inter-chip interference (ICI) caused by severe frequency-selective fading. In this paper, we propose a joint Tx/iterative Rx frequency-domain equalization (FDE) based on minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion and successive MUI cancellation (MUIC) for DS-CDMA uplink. In the proposed scheme, each user applies one-tap Tx FDE before transmitting signal. At the base station, joint one-tap Rx FDE and successive MUIC is iteratively performed. The FDE weights of users and base station are jointly optimized based on the MMSE criterion in order to reduce MUI and ICI while exploiting channel frequency-selectivity. Computer simulation results show that the proposed scheme provides much improved bit error rate (BER) performance than the conventional iterative Rx MMSE-FDE with successive MUIC.","['Kazuki Takeda', 'Fumiyuki Adachi']",2,"['341bec98-c4fd-4dc7-a08e-e406a376713b', '3c904293-7b11-461c-9c4e-fb9d385f679f', '3d50d987-3910-4e1a-bc9a-2e52271b6bf0', '3eb23f08-8329-422a-9ad7-ef52ff35c3dc', '467280fc-4842-44cd-87d1-06c5ebd83321', '50722a16-050e-4288-b240-642ca76f8beb', '591d1e33-1424-448a-b46e-e1eada1eb6d2', 'd391d509-1593-41ce-b50d-bb41943a2401']",Multi-User Joint Tx/Iterative Rx MMSE-FDE and Successive MUI Cancellation for Uplink DS-CDMA,vehicular technology conference,2011,4af76e5b-740b-4758-a99f-e7df8baef3e2
"A collection of primitive operations for molecular diagram sketching has been developed. These primitives compose a concise set of operations which can be used to construct publication-quality 2 D coordinates for molecular structures using a bare minimum of input bandwidth. The input requirements for each primitive consist of a small number of discrete choices, which means that these primitives can be used to form the basis of a user interface which does not require an accurate pointing device. This is particularly relevant to software designed for contemporary mobile platforms. The reduction of input bandwidth is accomplished by using algorithmic methods for anticipating probable geometries during the sketching process, and by intelligent use of template grafting.

"The inverse problem of reconstructing the shape of dielectric cylinders by aspect-limited multimonostatic multifrequency electromagnetic scattering data is dealt with. The problem is formulated as a linear one by means of the physical-optics approximation distributional approach. The difference with respect to the case of perfectly electrical conducting scatterers is pointed out, since the penetrability of the scatterers is taken into account by considering the contribution of the “shadowed” side to the local reflection coefficient. The adopted model allows one to predict that both the “illuminated” and “shadowed” sides of the scatterer provide contribution to the reconstructed image but with a delocalization depending on the relative dielectric permittivity. The numerical results confirm this expectation and show the effectiveness of the approach.","['Adriana Brancaccio', 'Giovanni Leone']",13,"['007b085b-5ba7-4e16-943d-65f6849efcf6', '0d7e061b-6522-45c3-80d2-e77e49043038', '17e6caaa-e0c6-4ac1-ba54-8c99e9b3ed16', '681d64b3-fc7f-4197-b814-9b795c86853b', '747bb1e5-ef50-4866-8372-5483d8bd276a', '8fc5e925-14e0-4fc1-9ea8-fba7f3792c9e', '9bc0dff9-262f-41fe-8a52-07d65f251565', 'bbf69c35-6291-4c1e-862e-2af326e7cb97', 'f1205b1c-a928-4b42-bade-4ab94c909b41']",Multimonostatic Shape Reconstruction of Two-Dimensional Dielectric Cylinders by a Kirchhoff-Based Approach,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,2010,4af7c56b-7933-4b1e-bb00-f8c891d1fd4f
"Multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MB-OFDM) ultra wideband (UWB) systems have drawn much attention for its high spectrum efficiency and multiple access capability.

The separation method consist of continuous flow of a blood sample (diluted in PBS) through a microfluidic channel which presents on the bottom ldquodotsrdquo of ferromagnetic layer. By applying a magnetic field perpendicular on the flowing direction, the ferromagnetic ldquodotsrdquo generate a gradient of magnetic field which amplifies the magnetic force. As a result, the red blood cells are captured on the bottom of the microfluidic channel while the rest of the blood is collected at the outlet.

"Network coding in cyclic networks meets more problems than in acyclic networks. Recently, S.-Y.R.Li et al.proposed a framework of convolutional network coding (CNC) as well as its four properties for cyclic networks with theoretic fundamentals of discrete valuation ring (DVR). The four properties, Convolutional Multicast (CM), Convolutional Broadcast (CB), Convolutional Dispersion (CD) and Basic Convolutional NetworkCode (BCNC), are notions of increasing strength in this order with regard to linear independence among the global encoding kernels. The existence of a BCNC then implies the existence ofthe rest. That is, BCNC is the best convolutional network code in terms of linear independence. However, the code construction algorithm of BCNC was not presented explicitly. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to propose a polynomial time construction algorithm of BCNC for network coding in cyclic networks, which can deal with different characteristics of cycles in terms of topology, including link cycles but flow acyclic, simpleflow cycles and knots. Finally, polynomial time complexity of the algorithm was proved as well as its effectiveness.","['Jiaqing Huang', 'Liang Wang', 'Wenqing Cheng', 'Hui Li']",8,"['2203f921-67d7-42e7-bb8b-a4f39165afc8', '222e8196-b98b-47bc-a679-641bbf57b770', '24173fe9-8fd0-410a-8695-414f594912a0', '3f600760-bca4-4f35-a200-8b46fa5a530e', '5d584f7b-fc9e-4ae0-905c-569ecb90f524', '90a424e0-d969-4c63-8ab0-fb6922d335d8', 'c6a486bf-9458-45ec-8edf-7046a91f1dc4', 'c9c7cc8f-37d5-4b08-aab5-16037c79f2be']",Polynomial Time Construction Algorithm of BCNC for Network Coding in Cyclic Networks,,2009,4af835b2-6d77-4601-95eb-56adb4f2c5ea
"This paper presents a new way of addressing and routing for mobile ad hoc networks on the basis of contextual information such as air pressure, brightness, wind direction and strength, or GPS position. The most common use case of context-based addressing is group communication: A participant sends a message to an a priori unspecified set of recipients, but indicates the context in which the message could be useful for a potential receiver. In contrast to infrastructure networks the sender no longer designates the receiver of its message with a distinct identifier. Instead, each recipient using his local context decides by himself, whether the message is useful for him and whether it should be sent out again. The modeling of the necessary application knowledge is done as ontologies in OWL (Web Ontology Language). As an example scenario, a wind gust warning on highways using a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is described: the warning message should be sent to all vehicles on the same route containing the place where the wind was detected. The models are applied in a prototypical example scenario in order to show the performance of the approach through a simulation, using the JiST/SWANS simulator for mobile ad hoc networks. The results show that the number of messages that are necessary to warn all vehicles in a given environment of the wind danger can be reduced by half – as opposed to a simple flooding of the network.","['Robert Eigner', 'Christoph Mair']",3,"['24e2f1a0-edc8-46d0-8225-d595cd5bada8', '464036ca-e625-4da5-ae96-422ea52c79ba', '75a7ccd7-ed02-4635-9508-667f52554cd5', '99c293b0-76d9-412b-b01e-4a06d7626477', 'b9fbc5ee-4527-40de-9480-a92fa3b45d0c', 'cbe09b55-c776-4ef9-94f4-c7cf073a3c89', 'd212dc94-98c4-4aef-813b-02be9b797f3c']",Using Context Ontologies for Addressing and Routing in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks,international conference on networks,2009,4af84849-861b-4b81-b722-8717714e7639
"We propose a novel feature, local histogram of figure/ground segmentations, for robust and efficient background subtraction (BGS) in dynamic scenes (e.g., waving trees, ripples in water, illumination changes, camera jitters, etc.). We represent each pixel as a local histogram of figure/ground segmentations, which aims at combining several candidate solutions that are produced by simple BGS algorithms to get a more reliable and robust feature for BGS. The background model of each pixel is constructed as a group of weighted adaptive local histograms of figure/ground segmentations, which describe the structure properties of the surrounding region. This is a natural fusion because multiple complementary BGS algorithms can be used to build background models for scenes. Moreover, the correlation of image variations at neighboring pixels is explicitly utilized to achieve robust detection performance since neighboring pixels tend to be similarly affected by environmental effects (e.g., dynamic scenes). Experimental results demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposedmethod by comparing with four representatives of the state of the art in BGS.","['Bineng Zhong', 'Hongxun Yao', 'Shaohui Liu', 'Xiaotong Yuan']",7,"['091033ac-f2b8-4b63-945d-e607501cf0d9', '1a0d29bf-0ca0-4e91-8558-811aae308f59', '2807e6ff-b9a5-49ec-8b9f-892aee014156', '34db451a-6a13-4c18-ac45-db401f2e499f', '367e0d1d-430f-46fb-aeea-448768eb8928', '3d5522b4-7b27-4187-85f9-164a1b382d8e', '4ad58b7d-d702-4cf0-a73e-85aac845fd40', '598c5808-ed24-4b30-b7b2-565520d442e6', '868dfe8c-9c9f-46a8-84c3-4f223feb356a', 'afe12c61-72e0-4526-bb3c-5c91bb63739d', 'b27d0548-1625-458e-a039-9a8ffa8b12a0', 'b2823eb1-e628-48fd-8bb7-95504a20f054', 'b7380d17-27b2-48ea-a8dd-37e63c9952c9', 'bc04fbca-3dd5-413c-8576-390f77655bf1', 'cb81c54e-eb9a-4bee-980b-cf1d6ff1f418', 'd24968e7-b7b3-4907-a99f-a4c602d7c026', 'dc1711b4-6d7e-4db1-917c-3171f0c3d206', 'e19bbd8e-c85b-4cde-a86f-65ea06db1373', 'e66464dd-acc1-453b-ae14-0c044de0a0e4', 'ee3c630c-8557-4cff-b74d-3eba144a5ba1', 'f45b1e53-6ece-40d9-8b84-6d3b77ea7a7d', 'f4a38d7a-d63f-4df7-8961-d91a49a2d0d6', 'f5ec4eaf-7cb6-4e0a-b9d4-e3877cc393c9', 'fe4934dc-beb3-4c3d-a1e5-0fb8c8bfbcc0']",Local histogram of figure/ground segmentations for dynamic background subtraction,EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing,2010,4af84d38-c356-47e7-b616-4736e9a6929a
"In real-coded genetic algorithms (GAs), some crossover operators do not work well on functions which have their optimum at the corner of the search space. To cope with this problem, we have proposed a boundary extension method which allows individuals to be located within a limited space beyond the boundary of the search space. In this paper, we give an analysis of the boundary extension methods from the viewpoint of sampling bias and perform a comparative study on the effect of applying two boundary extension methods, namely the boundary extension by mirroring (BEM) and the boundary extension with extended selection (BES). We were able to confirm that to use sampling methods which have smaller sampling bias had good performance on both functions which have their optimum at or near the boundaries of the search space, and functions which have their optimum at the center of the search space. The BES/SD/A (BES by shortest distance selection with aging) had good performance on functions which have their optimum at or near the boundaries of the search space. We also confirmed that applying the BES/SD/A did not cause any performance degradation on functions which have their optimum at the center of the search space.","['Shigeyoshi Tsutsui', 'Devid E.

This paper introduces an implementation of a halfduplex decode-and-forward cooperative algorithm using the complete complementary code (CCC) sets. These code sets have an impulsive autocorrelation sum among each set and a cross correlation sum along the set size that vanishes for all shifts. Each user is assigned a set of spreading codes to spread his data and send each of the resulting signals on a different sub-band. The decode-and-forward cooperative procedure is applied and a receiver consisting of parallel branches matched filter followed by a λ-MRC combiner is used for detection. It is demonstrated that the probability of error performance of the proposed algorithm is very close to the performance of the analytical closed-form probability of error in similar transmission conditions. The algorithm is also compared with a noncooperative multiband direct-sequence code division multiple access (MB DS-CDMA) algorithm using the complete complementary sets.

Extensive numerical tests conducted on instances with up to 1000 items show the effectiveness of these methods in terms of computational effort and solution quality.

And brightness decrease problem resulted from the lack of the number of the sustain pulse can be solved without a limitation to sustain pulse width. Operational principle and its features are illustrated comparing with conventional approaches. The validity of the proposed sustain driver is verified through experiments using a prototype equipped with a 7.5 (inch) diagonal panel, which is operated at 200 (kHz) switching frequency.","['Feel-soon Kang', 'Seok-Gyu Oh']",50,"['664f0e87-602c-4f5e-ab6d-631a39975fb2', 'bf2c71f1-4db9-4580-94c1-5f8f0f3d720a']",An efficiently revised sustain driver for AC plasma display,IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics,2004,4af87a44-bd34-431d-874c-0a5a42a6d962
"A macro has been developed that allows for automated statistical analyses of particles. It can be used with binary images from any source, and is developed for use with lacustrine, marine, Aeolian, and marine sediments. The macro code is freely available, and runs on open-source software. It has been specially designed to accommodate very small regions of interest relative to particle size, and to produce continuous downcore stratigraphies. The macro runs quickly, requires no user-interaction, is easily modifiable, saves 'raw data' for algorithm checking and further analyses, and can run in a mode that quantifies cracks and other disturbances on images. The macro allows for rapid analyses of relatively long sedimentary sequences, and provides relevant sedimentary interpretations of transport and depositional processes. Examples of output from two lacustrine sediment records and one marine record are shown.","['Ted Lewis', 'Pierre Francus', 'Raymond S.

"Saving power is the major goal in every area either in industry or in campus. However, there are more uncertainties in campus. For instances, the usages of air conditioners in the classroom are irregular events. In the other hand, the lighting in the parking area is the regular event. For the regular event, we use the unstable green energy like wind or solar to save the electric cost. For the irregular event, we use the stable electricity but managed by dynamic power dispatch system to efficiently handle usages of air conditioners in the classroom in order to reduce cost. This dispatch system is the integration of Internet, network, coded radio frequency, database, interfacing technology, and campus administration computerization servers. By using the existing media and devices, the set-up of this system is without extra expensive cost. This hybrid strategy is simulated in a University with about 15000 students and more than 100 classrooms equipped with air conditioners. We can estimate to save more than 10% power than usual.","['Ching-Lung Lin', 'Yuan-Chuen Hwang', 'Ching-Feng Lin']",50,"['66d328f2-23e4-4e1b-9bf4-cb23a399de48', 'b20b7ecf-df88-4bb7-a03c-ca1ddbee8665', 'c3a3705d-acf5-409d-945a-2ca74d82fec5', 'e50b9492-f79a-45b5-a860-e9f8f2e53854']",Development of A Hierarchical Saving Power System for Campus,computer supported cooperative work in design,2009,4af892c4-33f3-4280-9658-439261078348

"A new multi-objective genetic algorithm has been proposed for testing crosstalk delay faults in asynchronous sequential circuits that reduces average power dissipation during test application. The proposed Elitist Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm ENGA-based Automatic Test Pattern Generation ATPG for crosstalk induced delay faults generates test pattern set that has high fault coverage and low switching activity. Redundancy is introduced in ENGA-based ATPG by modifying the fault dropping phase and hence a very good reduction in transition activity is achieved. Tests are generated for several asynchronous SIS benchmark circuits. Experimental results demonstrate that ENGA gives higher fault coverage, reduced transitions and compact test vectors for most of the asynchronous benchmark circuits when compared with those generated by Weighted Sum Genetic Algorithm WSGA.","['S.

"Field measurements of a DVB-SH network with both satellite and terrestrial transmitters are presented. The system is a Single Frequency Network transmitting video streams to vehicular terminals with up to 4 branches of receiver antenna diversity. The signal is transmitted in the S-band at 2.1859 GHz with both time and frequency synchronization of the terrestrial repeaters with the satellite's signal. The time and frequency variations are cancelled out at the satellite gateway, but because these can not be canceled at all locations, and because the satellite's position in space is variable (in an inclined orbit) the terrestrial repeaters are made to cancel the residual time and frequency variation. The field measurements include data taken in late 2008 through 2009 with multiple repeaters located in several cities including Las Vegas, NV, Raleigh and Durham, NC, as well as various morphologies, and with elevation angles to the satellite ranging from 25 °  to 52 °  . This paper presents coverage data for these various morphologies, modulation and code rates, as well as various MPE-iFEC interleaver settings used to ameliorate the effects of long shadowed intervals such as when the vehicle goes under highways or bridges where there signal is obscured for several seconds. We observed excellent performance in hybrid mode with better than 99% of the measured seconds error free.

With the evolution of the Internet, access to massive amounts of financial data, typically in the form of financial statements, is widespread. Managers and stakeholders are in need of a data-mining tool allowing them to quickly and accurately analyze this data.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of self-organizing maps for analyzing financial performance of international pulp and paper companies. For the study, financial data, in the form of seven financial ratios, was collected, using the Internet as the primary source of information. A total of 77 companies, and six regional averages, were included in the study. The time frame of the study was the period 1995-00.

"Backtracking is a basic strategy to solve constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs).

This is the first time an exact phase transition of backtrack-free search can be identified on some random CSPs.

"In this paper, we present an approach to enable a humanoid robot to autonomously climb up spiral staircases. This task is substantially more challenging than climbing straight stairs since careful repositioning is needed. Our system globally estimates the pose of the robot, which is subsequently refined by integrating visual observations. In this way, the robot can accurately determine its relative position with respect to the next step. We use a 3D model of the environment to project edges corresponding to stair contours into monocular camera images. By detecting edges in the images and associating them to projected model edges, the robot is able to accurately locate itself towards the stairs and to climb them. We present experiments carried out with a Nao humanoid equipped with a 2D laser range finder for global localization and a low-cost monocular camera for short-range sensing. As we show in the experiments, the robot reliably climbs up the steps of a spiral staircase.","['Stefan Osswald', 'Attila Görög', 'Armin Hornung', 'Maren Bennewitz']",36,"['1a6370ef-ce41-4812-8006-167cbd0b14de', '2df80900-79b6-4c9e-b375-429780a13aa2', '31e2a609-ea77-4f78-b8a9-43d4dfb4bd7a', '4945b805-699c-4b9d-a4fa-67a6dfa81543', '58fe84d2-8232-4685-b7c4-3788f4bf64f3', '9e334ad8-2b85-4e20-a3e3-693af4de816f', 'c6bb2fc3-74b8-4a3e-b2d7-cbdd88876c3f', 'e0f6b2f4-02f1-4c21-a26b-8e589bff057c', 'e2bb45c4-315a-445b-9ed9-16e76117edfb', 'ebfca554-7a3c-4597-954b-07336a2e3030', 'f1052e70-33ca-4ed7-8bff-67bc9b478866']",Autonomous climbing of spiral staircases with humanoids,intelligent robots and systems,2011,4af904ea-5da4-42a8-a27d-3558d441f96d
"Indoor tracking and navigation is a fundamental need for pervasive and context-aware smartphone applications. Although indoor maps are becoming increasingly available, there is no practical and reliable indoor map matching solution available at present. We present MapCraft, a novel, robust and responsive technique that is extremely computationally efficient (running in under 10 ms on an Android smartphone), does not require training in different sites, and tracks well even when presented with very noisy sensor data. Key to our approach is expressing the tracking problem as a conditional random field (CRF), a technique which has had great success in areas such as natural language processing, but has yet to be considered for indoor tracking. Unlike directed graphical models like Hidden Markov Models, CRFs capture arbitrary constraints that express how well observations support state transitions, given map constraints. Extensive experiments in multiple sites show how MapCraft outperforms state-of-the art approaches, demonstrating excellent tracking error and accurate reconstruction of tortuous trajectories with zero training effort. As proof of its robustness, we also demonstrate how it is able to accurately track the position of a user from accelerometer and magnetometer measurements only (i.e. gyro- and WiFi-free). We believe that such an energy-efficient approach will enable always-on background localisation, enabling a new era of location-aware applications to be developed.","['Zhuoling Xiao', 'Hongkai Wen', 'Andrew Markham', 'Niki Trigoni']",50,"['01ff3efc-75ab-4488-87d0-25320a48e770', '02c28d46-4eb0-430e-86bf-aa4ff0f1bb5f', '0edf3645-9dff-488d-8a12-af1f458b10df', '238ed3ff-48d7-4b76-8ee6-23f3cdd86141', '35e5eb4b-5d0d-49d8-b620-e224fd930d91', '380d28ea-a6bc-40ee-984f-3722aa68fa9b', '4e0a9bc2-59c7-4e1e-98e4-a7413acfeb46', '57b12ee7-510c-4252-9099-3fe8cb4798bf', '5d6e7cc1-06ec-4df2-9848-07798188de79', '6ad3f9de-ac57-4051-9fe0-8d44e5be86b1', '78bf1844-1422-4aa4-bfb2-5b9af4ef6e7b', '7e6aa7f3-79ba-48ea-a7ce-3d8d132e4d7b', '86439347-ea57-43b1-9919-18a7dbac764f', '8e9f443d-07b4-48fa-9933-7ef35d1eb1d9', '908046f7-e1ec-4580-bd5a-d48e5f9eab7b', '951d6b74-c3e1-4b76-98e3-90da52b652e6', '9b9d7a73-d8cd-4192-bc70-dc96b825c3f3', 'aa5452cd-9839-4e2c-8b00-1c342232af64', 'ae829318-5d10-461d-9c99-34a95a3f8732', 'b093dfbd-9fba-469a-a5db-590899557229', 'b41f020b-fd03-4b88-8c2e-9cca03a88513', 'd8116977-0962-4d4d-832d-f9b0a095c75c', 'e11e5b98-c232-43cb-979c-580ee45e7033', 'ec062675-2148-49bb-afda-1622e11f536f', 'f8a9df79-9be7-4333-a71c-327040f67fcd', 'ff4edc5b-a005-4d74-bbdf-bb6659fc76b8']",Lightweight map matching for indoor localisation using conditional random fields,information processing in sensor networks,2014,4af911e0-68ee-4dd8-bebc-bded775f284a
"Segmentation is generally regarded as partitioning space at the boundary of an object so as to represent the object's shape, pose, size, and topology. Some images, however, contain so much noise that distinct boundaries are not forthcoming even after the object has been identified. We have used statistical methods based on medial features in Real Time 3D echocardiography to locate the left ventricular axis, even though the precise boundaries of the ventricle are simply not visible in the data. We then produce a fuzzy labeling of ventricular voxels to represent the shape of the ventricle without any explicit boundary. The fuzzy segmentation permits calculation of total ventricular volume as well as determination of local boundary equivalencies, both of which are validated against manual tracings on 155 left ventricles. The method uses a medial-based compartmentalization of the object that is generalizable to any shape.","['George D. Stetten', 'Stephen M.

"To date, holographic configuration speeds have remained limited to 16 mus because of issues related to the architecture of optically reconfigurable gate array VLSIs (ORGA-VLSIs). Therefore, to improve the issue, optically differential reconfigurable gate array VLSIs (ODRGA-VLSIs) have been developed and have achieved zero-overhead and nanosecond optical reconfiguration.

"The impact of finite intermediate frequency (IF) on the performance of heterodyne ASK lightwave systems is examined and quantified in the presence of laser phase noise and shot noise. For negligible linewidths, it is shown that certain finite choices of IF (R/sub b/,3R/sub b//2,2R/sub b/,5R/sub b//2, etc.) lead to the same ideal bit-error-rate (BER) performance as infinite choices of IF. Results indicate that for negligible linewidths the worst case sensitivity penalty is 0.9 dB for proper heterodyne detection and occurs when f/sub IF/=1.25 R/sub b/. For nonnegligible linewidths (e.g., when /spl Delta//spl nu/T/spl ges/0.04) the sensitivity penalty is always less than 0.9 dB for finite choices of IF. The analysis presented does lead to a closed-form signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) expression at the decision gate of the receiver which can readily be used for BER and sensitivity penalty computations. The SNR expression provided includes all the key system parameters of interest such as system bit rate (R/sub b/), the peak IF SNR (/spl xi/), laser linewidth (/spl Delta//spl nu/), and the IF filter expansion factor (/spl alpha/). The findings of this work suggest that the number of channels in a multichannel heterodyne ASK lightwave system can be increased substantially by properly choosing a small value for the IF at the expense of a small penalty <1 dB. On the negative side, IF frequency stabilization becomes a more critical requirement in multichannel systems employing small values of IF.","['Ozan K. Tonguz', 'Okan M. Tanrikulu', 'Leonid G.

In this paper both normal-band and narrow-band PIFA antennas for small terminals are compared through numerical simulations and measurements for different UMTS bandwidths. It is found that using different antennas for the transmitting and receiving regions of the frequency duplex it is possible to achieve a significant improvement in terms of isolation. Measurement results show also that ohmic losses lower the total efficiency in the narrow-band case especially at low frequencies.,"['Mauro Pelosi', 'Ondrej Franek', 'Mikael B.

"In this letter, we propose an extension to the ordered subcarrier selection algorithm (OSSA) for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. The result is a simple algorithm for minimizing the bit error rate of the OFDM system at a fixed throughput. The proposed algorithm employs multiple modulations (non-uniform bit loading) within an OFDM symbol. However, unlike existing bit loading algorithms that have a very high computational complexity, the proposed algorithm is based only on the ordered statistics of the subcarrier gains and is consequently very simple. After ordering the subcarriers based on their gains, progressively higher order modulations are used with increasing gains. The key aspect here that greatly simplifies the algorithm is that the modulation used on a subcarrier depends only on the position of its gain in the ordered set and not on the actual values of the gains. We show an analytical approach for determining the parameters of the algorithm.",['Santosh Nagaraj'],4,"['0eea3792-f276-48aa-afb0-1df85231d705', '37f62192-28c2-4329-8395-38f06a71a1c6', '3a524149-ae8b-44b8-bbfa-bb82e58c2a1c', '3c11c1c5-331c-4424-a1ae-4e00b20feb41', '4f276522-807c-48ae-b23a-e548cd1593d3', '72e7bc2c-f611-4e53-b14f-6437d96394e4', 'ca050aff-3d13-4563-97ce-aded0f07d46c', 'fd7435f6-d07b-49ad-ad8f-392c4156fa24']",An extension to the ordered subcarrier selection algorithm (OSSA),IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,2009,4af9d4b0-7c2f-45c6-b700-664000c06e14
"In this paper, we present a supervised learning based approach for sub-pixel motion estimation. The novelty of this work is the learning based method itself which tries to learn the shifts from a large training database. Integer pixel shift is sub-divided and discretized to levels in both the horizontal and vertical direction. We pose the problem of motion estimation in a polar coordinate system. Shift estimation in the x and y direction has been posed as a problem of estimating r and thetas. The ordinal property of r has been used, and consequently, we employ a ranking based approach for estimating r. For thetas estimation we employ multi-class classification techniques.

"This paper considers the scheduling problem in a new slotted optical network called Time-Domain Wavelength Interleaved network (TWIN). The TWIN architecture possesses interesting properties, which may offer solutions for next-generation optical networks. Besides, better Quality of Service (QoS) could be achieved in TWIN by minimizing two parameters: queueing delay and delay variance. However, to the best of our knowledge, most of the existing scheduling algorithms in TWIN ignored consideration of QoS and focused mainly on maximizing the throughput. In this paper, we formulate the scheduling problem into an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem and propose a novel heuristic - Destination Slot Set (DSS) algorithm to solve it fast and efficiently. Besides, we derive an analytical model for TWIN and investigate the performance of DSS in it. By means of simulations, we demonstrate that our analytical model approximates the TWIN network very well; moreover, DSS incurs smaller queueing delay and delay variance, which ensures better QoS.","['Daojun Xue', 'Yang Qin', 'Chee Kheong Siew']",50,"['0cdaad7f-3106-4ccf-a14c-ff25a7f2144e', '34a6e091-15ce-49ee-9500-06ac6be8bba3', '369a6f2b-2f55-42af-8e41-5d890d42c7d1', '4c2b842e-6b7f-4ffd-b9b4-03fa78e248dd', '7966b1a7-c08a-4af7-9f00-0d4eee274215', '83a9c5ec-de59-49b8-910d-81f503ec66e7', '8edf2cab-0e22-4388-aacb-e70e7e5ef0c6', 'd771955e-8b9a-45ae-8ee2-fb20ebfb3007', 'ef9e003a-9e0f-4cc5-9635-ce74c6a68799']",Performance analysis of a novel traffic scheduling algorithm in slotted optical networks,Computer Communications,2007,4af9e0f4-4011-4a95-a28c-ad4a4b0aef81

"View-independence and user-independence are two fundamental requirements for hand posture recognition during natural human-robot interaction. However only a few research concerns on the two issues simultaneously. The difficulty for natural gesture-based human-robot interaction lies in that appearances of the same hand posture vary with different users from different viewing directions. In this paper, we propose a systematic feature selection approach based on Zernike moments and Isomap dimensionality reduction. A hierarchical classifier based on multivariate decision tree and piecewise linearization is developed to deal with the irregular distribution of the same hand postures. The proposed method is compared with other commonly used ones in hand posture recognition. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can effectively identify different hand postures, irrespective of viewing directions and users.","['Lizhong Gu', 'Jianbo Su']",50,"['2b78caef-45a8-4c0a-9f37-dcad3223c869', '2d1ac702-d981-4e13-b579-81a6334a6fa9', '473308a4-a098-4eae-8bbf-8c30bc7701a4', '49baf3bc-885c-4f82-9746-88d5cb58171d', '4c0ae3e7-45b4-441e-81b2-7b325af64e32', '4c8bdea5-81d3-4dce-ba43-52eb2559781e', '4f3b5bd2-1178-43be-99e0-e81c286847f9', '67cfb6a4-846a-4f7d-9fca-1fc9337663cd', '6da84a8d-86d5-41b9-94cd-7f4ce8670114', 'c89f2a9f-4988-4dfa-aaf9-1ad614880ad2', 'cd588654-1a99-4452-9cc4-293584add6bb', 'd8ed675b-5ea1-4941-8776-e012bae282de', 'e5681a6c-a40a-4c7a-895d-cf0fdf9815d2']",Natural hand posture recognition based on Zernike moments and hierarchical classifier,international conference on robotics and automation,2008,4afa09c8-e827-4e2d-9f9f-87d3f78788d5
"Prior research on language identification focused primarily on text and speech. In this paper, we focus on the visual modality and present a method for identifying sign languages solely from short video samples. The method is trained on unlabelled video data (unsupervised feature learning) and using these features, it is trained to discriminate between six sign languages (supervised learning). We ran experiments on short video samples involving 30 signers (about 6 hours in total). Using leave-one-signer-out cross-validation, our evaluation shows an average best accuracy of 84%. Given that sign languages are underresourced, unsupervised feature learning techniques are the right tools and our results indicate that this is realistic for sign language identification.","['Binyam Gebrekidan Gebre', 'O.A.

"As mobile nodes roam in a wireless network, they continuously associate with different access points and perform handoff operations. However, frequent handoffs can potentially incur unacceptable delays and even interruptions for interactive applications. To alleviate these negative impacts, we present novel association control algorithms that can minimize the frequency of handoffs occurred to mobile devices. Specifically, we show that a greedy LookAhead algorithm is optimal in the offline setting, where the user's future mobility is known. Inspired by such optimality, we further propose two online algorithms, namely LookBack and Track, that operate without any future mobility information. Instead, they seek to predict the lifetime of an association using randomization and statistical approaches, respectively. We evaluate the performance of these algorithms using both analysis and trace-driven simulations. The results show that the simple LookBack algorithm has surprisingly a competitive ratio .of (log k + 2), where k is the maximum number of APs that a user can hear at any time, and the Track algorithm can achieve near-optimal performance in practical scenarios.","['Minkyong Kim', 'Zhen Liu', 'Srinivasan Parthasarathy', 'Dimitrios Pendarakis', 'Hao Yang']",33,"['1041f7d4-049b-4d96-888f-1a2ef70963bb', '4af630aa-ab07-43d3-943b-1934b31c5def', '7ea803e8-77fd-420b-8ddb-ddd4d751b4a7', '9b589c09-e3b0-43d2-a1f7-c8d56a5c5e45', 'ae6c2d01-b8e0-4e87-8757-433cc35165ef', 'e483a7df-ee31-4e6c-b91f-c49ae747b926', 'ee5f368e-634c-45d9-8f5f-de6f83a03e1f', 'f830b1cd-d8ff-4de1-8364-2a4fdb208d91']",Association Control in Mobile Wireless Networks,international conference on computer communications,2008,4afa1c0d-f551-4057-a023-1f54d64f3210

In our model, a firm undertakes a small-scale pilot project to learn, via Bayesian updating, about the project's profitability, which is known to be in one of two possible states. The firm continuously observes the project's cumulative profit, but the true state of the profitability is not immediately revealed because of the inherent noise in the profit stream. The firm bases its exit or expansion decision on the posterior probability distribution of the profitability. The optimal policy is characterized by a pair of thresholds for the posterior probability.

"Imagine a network of entities, being it replica servers aiming to minimize the probability of data loss, players of online team-based games and tournaments, or companies that look into co-branding opportunities. The objective of each entity in any of these scenarios is to find a few suitable partners to help them achieve a shared goal: replication of the data for fault tolerance, winning the game, successful marketing campaign. All information attainable by the entities is limited to the profiles of other entities that can be used to assess the pairwise fitness. How can they create teams without help of any centralized component and without going into each other’s way? We propose a decentralized algorithm that helps nodes in the network to form groups of a specific size.

"Natural signals and images are well-known to be approximately sparse in transform domains such as Wavelets and DCT. This property has been heavily exploited in various applications in image processing and medical imaging. Compressed sensing exploits the sparsity of images or image patches in a transform domain or synthesis dictionary to reconstruct images from undersampled measurements. In this work, we focus on blind compressed sensing, where the underlying sparsifying transform is a priori unknown, and propose a framework to simultaneously reconstruct the underlying image as well as the sparsifying transform from highly undersampled measurements. The proposed block coordinate descent type algorithms involve highly efficient optimal updates. Importantly, we prove that although the proposed blind compressed sensing formulations are highly nonconvex, our algorithms are globally convergent (i.e., they converge from any initialization) to the set of critical points of the objectives defining the formulations. These critical points are guaranteed to be at least partial global and partial local minimizers. The exact point(s) of convergence may depend on initialization. We illustrate the usefulness of the proposed framework for magnetic resonance image reconstruction from highly undersampled k-space measurements. As compared to previous methods involving the synthesis dictionary model, our approach is much faster, while also providing promising reconstruction quality.","['Saiprasad Ravishankar', 'Yoram Bresler']",4,"['03a86014-31e3-406c-9399-78cfb5b60fa5', '05c85ace-c998-47cd-a285-f6ecfd72004d', '090f9668-06d3-44eb-89b5-63a22d4fb7b5', '19a42cd3-c8ae-4f71-8c8c-4eae6ca48345', '272f2b92-b244-4e66-9882-0366ef0169f5', '28e6e848-a661-40bd-8667-630e8575016a', '3841a242-27f8-4a05-b85f-384c187089ff', '3dd913b8-e22d-434e-9015-bf68fbbb7bef', '423615d7-7afc-4306-a4ab-5aba3fffaa4c', '4a4cdb63-5e57-4011-84d0-d18f851962aa', '5274364d-5af9-43e9-b9d0-23d45990458b', '527ec6c0-16af-4f80-ab81-77dee6e86268', '5782e11e-29cb-4d7b-a43e-25374d589565', '67441059-620e-4932-90dd-25d324e1f44f', '6ff01654-66d1-49c7-b526-1c8ed7fa893a', '7291a02d-1d94-48b7-a4e2-35406c0e52ad', '84e57745-f675-4d41-b3e9-1c6f4ddf1891', '906dfb65-3e0f-4f98-80c5-4cf69db19767', '9352148f-35cb-41d5-8fbf-2482b5144875', '97b001e0-ef8a-4c49-8bd6-3dd8b50b46f3', '981effae-2420-43f0-b22f-ec815af20c30', '995cba04-0175-4913-8b3c-a3f84580381f', 'a2f7081a-c2a2-47c6-b1ff-841415a3c23c', 'a53a3dda-b003-4d5c-96b1-e9afd8e35692', 'afafe659-41d6-44a5-8cad-3bc70be7297e', 'b4c33364-d849-4e81-8e4d-8033d0619c71', 'bb3c38fa-c2b0-4d4f-8c9d-ca1884343474', 'c1ceaf9b-605d-46a7-a9a0-2135cb856f3f', 'cfbb8760-4014-427b-b956-6074f70fe9cf', 'd868e809-1ed0-467f-b909-6a7131d79ca9', 'da3591c1-6a8f-4ac3-8481-b1fe147deb85', 'eeeeb5ab-ee6b-4eed-ac97-2c8984109e99', 'f02963ae-4068-43e7-9c02-ee1d3829b0ec', 'f3163d76-da71-4f76-a62a-31d157c0a182', 'f3dfad29-cb43-4bbd-9372-67de2c21b5e5', 'f56b877b-4060-4754-b303-e8140968544c', 'fb89fd35-c70d-48ac-9791-77bbdb6c224f']",Efficient Blind Compressed Sensing Using Sparsifying Transforms with Convergence Guarantees and Application to MRI,arXiv: Learning,2015,4afa9993-028d-4d4d-afe8-70ee7d723fa1
"The local pickup and delivery problem (LPDP) is an essential operational problem in intermodal industry. While the problem with deterministic settings is already difficult to solve, in reality, there exist a set of loads, called uncertain loads, which are unknown at the beginning of the day. But customers may call in during the day to materialize these loads. In this paper, we call the LPDP considering these uncertain loads as the stochastic LPDP. The problem description and the mathematical modeling of stochastic LPDP are discussed. Then, a simulation-based optimization approach is proposed to solve the problem, which features in a fast solution generation procedure and an intelligent simulation budget allocation framework. The numerical examples show the best strategy to consider the stochastic loads in the planning process and validate the benefits compared to its deterministic counterpart.","['Weiwei Chen', 'Jie Song', 'Leyuan Shi']",0,"['000caa92-4585-4b60-a558-e9233e717d28', '2d6550b8-4861-464d-9261-3cf8c83ef513', '304e1379-5d84-428f-bc30-867f5329503b', '415e7d8a-5f44-4fd2-8ead-87f0682077b4', '42e10060-658e-462d-9c74-d84d02796153', '630b0e3b-e179-40f5-a43b-16be7d550ab7', '8a134ae9-b9ce-4c89-88a6-e5c976c5f812', 'a391f00d-c00c-4de0-86e7-c743f808a805', 'c2207671-a597-4332-880a-25a4900eb50e', 'f70cef95-bfef-4767-a45e-848b47abe3f9']",Optimizing local pickup and delivery with uncertain loads,winter simulation conference,2011,4afaa302-0e2d-4eac-b056-805f287a3304
"A new object-based coding system for a class of dynamic image-based representations called plenoptic videos (PVs) is proposed. PVs are simplified dynamic light fields, where the videos are taken at regularly spaced locations along line segments instead of a 2-D plane. In the proposed object-based approach, objects at different depth values are segmented to improve the rendering quality. By encoding PVs at the object level, desirable functionalities such as scalability of contents, error resilience, and interactivity with an individual image-based rendering (IBR) object can be achieved. Besides supporting the coding of texture and binary shape maps for IBR objects with arbitrary shapes, the proposed system also supports the coding of grayscale alpha maps as well as depth maps (geometry information) to respectively facilitate the matting and rendering of the IBR objects. Both temporal and spatial redundancies among the streams in the PV are exploited to improve the coding performance, while avoiding excessive complexity in selective decoding of PVs to support fast rendering speed. Advanced spatial/temporal prediction methods such as global disparity-compensated prediction, as well as direct prediction and its extensions are developed. The bit allocation and rate control scheme employing a new convex optimization-based approach are also introduced. Experimental results show that considerable improvements in coding performance are obtained for both synthetic and real scenes, while supporting the stated object-based functionalities.","['King To Ng', 'Qing Wu', 'Shing-Chow Chan', 'Heung-Yeung Shum']",50,"['01685c08-98ef-445b-ad28-3d3f879e8de0', '05fbfdfe-6942-418e-b967-056886c0e744', '1e9a9e99-bbc9-4803-b53c-8d501542d31b', '1ed088ce-da61-446e-abd4-7b2894cffb86', '2f305b67-85b7-4374-b2eb-9305e433f477', '3393d7c8-64eb-4d06-b752-b6afc44cdfc1', '38a17f1e-f573-4c44-8b02-ec84f9ba3148', '38d0845d-8ed0-491f-9a18-417af9cba7b3', '5976a700-7757-4fd1-8c67-e40967b442db', '634d15de-4cc1-4ad9-b270-f30ea160aa31', '6ec47110-a96b-4aa3-b0f4-a0d74350154c', '7076d71b-e504-49af-ad35-cd1f2d12f5d6', '7c78306f-870f-422c-9c71-4d21c0ae7692', '7f7f0e24-7e81-4dea-9e20-0799d44345b8', '87a3e0c6-9219-41ee-8638-ea7a86fb8ef3', '8fe0365b-739e-4d3b-8490-9e03918b0861', '96583e43-ef79-400b-b072-e4099586ab28', '968443c0-3010-4eea-aabe-2789aa159310', '9ebe0571-d97e-428f-a8a6-99fef418b59f', '9ee8bd1d-6c0d-4f7d-8d11-68bcc5cb17d7', 'a511abf9-70d5-47e0-8b91-819f5ec98812', 'ab0671ba-b9af-414a-ad8b-59751ae03019', 'c05717ef-0cd5-4f66-b355-c27cc584c286', 'c18f4630-af32-42b6-aa66-810d275b2981', 'c3d148ce-5594-44b7-893b-a0262b70e514', 'cadb3b7c-be62-4e9a-aa16-4588a862f616', 'd0aa0aa3-fd48-43af-8180-e28202368f80', 'd49aeb23-e3ce-4d92-8646-3510cbde59c9', 'd8e26e2a-f32b-4127-8855-2b91434c48ac', 'eec4caa3-9779-4d00-b9ea-54cb52082466', 'f0887f29-b2e1-4971-a369-4df8b83b8996', 'f2df6043-156e-4e1c-9cbf-4bb0422b9b48', 'fdc002eb-088c-41fd-b9a7-b07b1f005772', 'ff1aae7b-b0f1-4e4c-a59b-85fada4dece6']",Object-Based Coding for Plenoptic Videos,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology,2010,4afaac9e-f8c6-4ab9-be3a-266afb1865fe
"This paper presents an adaptive reconstruction method of missing textures based on an inverse projection via sparse representation. The proposed method approximates original and corrupted textures in lower-dimensional subspaces by using the sparse representation technique. Then, this approach effectively solves problems of not being able to directly estimate an inverse projection for reconstructing missing textures. Furthermore, even if target textures contain missing areas, the proposed method enables adaptive generation of the subspaces by monitoring errors caused in their known neighboring textures by the estimated inverse projection. Consequently, since the optimal inverse projection is adaptively estimated for each texture, successful reconstruction of the missing areas can be expected. Experimental results show impressive improvement of the proposed reconstruction technique over previously reported reconstruction techniques.","['Takahiro Ogawa', 'Miki Haseyama']",0,"['2df8a872-cc23-4e20-9fba-6fe96eed3957', '51b4b3c5-8664-48e0-95a7-52bd04b56dac', '98c5d42e-f7d4-466e-9604-694756d86397', 'c1ceaf9b-605d-46a7-a9a0-2135cb856f3f']",Adaptive reconstruction method of missing textures based on inverse projection via sparse representation,international conference on multimedia and expo,2010,4afab6d9-1a58-4640-8ef7-388ae849fb7f

"Scientific misconduct is usually assumed to be self-serving. This paper, however, proposes to distinguish between two types of scientific misconduct: ‘type one scientific misconduct’ is self-serving and leads to falsely positive conclusions about one’s own work, while ‘type two scientific misconduct’ is other-harming and leads to falsely negative conclusions about someone else’s work. The focus is then on the latter type, and three known issues are identified as specific forms of such scientific misconduct: biased quality assessment, smear, and officially condoning scientific misconduct. These concern the improper ways how challenges of the prevailing opinion are thwarted in the modern world. The central issue is pseudoskepticism: uttering negative conclusions about someone else’s work that are downright false. It is argued that this may be an emotional response, rather than a calculated strategic action. Recommendations for educative and punitive measures are given to prevent and to deal with these three forms of scientific misconduct.",['Marcoen J. T. F.

Each case can be characterized by simple conditions on the present short rate rt. We give conditions under which the short rate process converges to a limit distribution and describe the risk-neutral limit distribution in terms of its cumulant generating function.

"The Internet is a complex structure arising from the interconnection of numerous autonomous systems (AS), each exercising its own administrative policies to reflect the commercial agreements behind the interconnection. However, routing in service overlay networks is quite capable of violating these policies to its advantage. To prevent these violations, we see an impending drive in the current Internet to detect and filter overlay traffic. In this paper, we first present results from a case study overlay network, constructed on top of Planetlab, that helps us gain insights into the frequency and characteristics of the different inter-domain policy violations. We further investigate the impact of two types of overlay traffic filtering that aim to prevent these routing policy violations: blind filtering and policy- aware filtering. We show that such filtering can be detrimental to the performance of overlay routing. We next consider two approaches that allow the overlay network to realize the full advantage of overlay routing in this context. In the first approach, overlay nodes are added so that good overlay paths do not represent inter-domain policy violations. In the second approach, the overlay acquires transit permits from certain ASes that allow certain policy violations to occur. We develop a single cost-sharing framework that allows the incorporation of both approaches into a single strategy. We formulate and solve an optimization problem that aims to determine how the overlay network should allocate a given budget between paying for additional overlay nodes and paying for transit permits to ASes. We illustrate the use of this approach on our case study overlay network and evaluate its performance under varying network characteristics.","['Srinivasan Seetharaman', 'Mostafa H.

"This paper presents a sensor-fusion framework for video-based navigation. Video-based navigation offers the advantages over existing approaches. With this type of navigation, road signs are directly superimposed onto the video of the road scene, as opposed to those superimposed onto a 2-D map, as is the case with conventional navigation systems. Drivers can then follow the virtual signs in the video to travel to the destination. The challenges of video-based navigation require the use of multiple sensors. The sensor-fusion framework that we propose has two major components: (1) a computer vision module for accurately detecting and tracking the road by using partition sampling and auxiliary variables and (2) a sensor-fusion module using multiple particle filters to integrate vision, Global Positioning Systems (GPSs), and Geographical Information Systems (GISs). GPS and GIS provide prior knowledge about the road for the vision module, and the vision module, in turn, corrects GPS errors.","['Li Bai', 'Yan Wang']",50,"['03bc0a3a-9ffc-4a46-8e4b-8c486c60f0d4', '0e9a6c64-60f7-4ce8-a971-b23142889fa9', '10197b2a-eb0f-4229-a1b0-d3a5c31ab35c', '4b55c4ae-a961-4d9a-a0ba-d1864ffb0930', '59649365-e552-4df0-a09e-55c9a432535a', '5d7a7840-73ec-4bc3-b42b-d5a65b75113c', '6272140f-21a8-4a60-b6ed-692675689595', '6ad1e0f6-2654-4db5-984b-4ec7ef5b6abe', '7aea093c-81d7-45fd-9118-68a506add50a', 'a6682380-d9de-4a12-912d-82460d80a878', 'a95e4733-c574-4c2f-a4ad-b582da2ef270', 'be7ebcb3-afa3-4631-a261-da8ba15b6706', 'c4283157-ef58-4cf5-9b95-7e6e76bea77e', 'c504f59c-073a-4c74-93e8-ed9de94add91', 'e4135355-db60-4ec8-bc44-dc44d93b1720', 'f17b0041-de7b-4a63-ac4a-fdda65a4d2f5', 'f9161fb0-5540-4595-9109-568adcd7806d', 'fe6b55d2-1f3e-4169-9185-150a46c08199']",A Sensor Fusion Framework Using Multiple Particle Filters for Video-Based Navigation,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2010,4afb1ba7-ece2-4fb0-9413-5cebf072dfea
"This paper describes an implementation of an evolution programme for the resource-constrained project scheduling problem. In essentials, the problem consists of two issues; (a) to determine the order of activities without violating precedence constraints and (b) subsequently to determine earliest start time for each activity according to available resources. How to determine the order of activation is critical to the problem, because if the order is determined, a schedule can be easily constructed with some determining procedures. The basic ideas of the proposed approach are; (a) using an evolution programme to evolve an appropriate order of activities and (b) using a fit-in-best procedure to calculate the earliest start times of activities. A new approach is addressed to guide how to design genetic operators; one operator is designed to perform a wide spread search to try to explore the area beyond local optima, whereas the other is designed to perform an intensive search to try to find an improved solut...","['Runwei Cheng', 'Mitsuo Gen']",50,,An evolution programme for the resource-constrained project scheduling problem,International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing,1998,4afb2c97-590b-48a3-9eb8-e9e8322d8768
"In this paper we propose a methodology for assessing the accuracy of techniques of wave field rendering through loudspeaker arrays. In order to measure the rendered wave field we adopt a solution based on a circular harmonic analysis of the sound field captured by a virtual microphone array. As a result of this analysis stage, we are able to compare the target, the theoretical and the measured wave fields, which may differ due to the non-ideality in the loudspeaker array or in the environment that generates some spurious reverberations. Moreover, in order to quantify the error between target, theoretical and measured wave fields, we define some evaluation metrics, based on RMSE and modal analysis of the acquired wave fields. We show some experimental results on real data.","['Antonio Canclini', 'Paolo Annibale', 'Fabio Antonacci', 'Augusto Sarti', 'Rudolf Rabenstein', 'Stefano Tubaro']",7,"['8dac8282-605c-486b-a64c-08a87f58b583', '9d98b9b3-957f-4816-8104-d914c73cd376', 'e60fe4d2-a4ef-43a2-9997-13392246654b']",A methodology for evaluating the accuracy of wave field rendering techniques,"international conference on acoustics, speech, and signal processing",2011,4afb3f34-2ca3-4a0c-a8b3-7a2bdb624dc1
"This article describes and presents examples of some techniques for the representation and interactive design of surfaces based on a parametric surface representation that user v-spline curves. These v-spline curves, similar in mathematical structure to v-splines, were developed as a more computationally efficient alternative to splines in tension. Although splines in tension can be modified to allow tension to be applied at each control point, the procedure is computationally expensive. The v-spline curve, however, uses more computationally tractable piecewise cubic curves segments, resulting in curves that are just as smoothly joined as those of a standard cubic spline. After presenting a review of v-splines and some new properties, this article extends their application to a rectangular grid of control points.

"In this paper using a utility-based approach, down-link packet transmission in a CDMA/TDMA cellular network is formulated as an optimization problem. A utility function corresponds to each packet served by a base-station that is an increasing function of the packet experienced delay and the channel gain, and a decreasing function of the base-station load. Unlike previous works, in this paper, the optimization objective is to maximize the total network utility instead of the base-station utility. We show that this optimization results in joint base-station assignment and packet scheduling. Therefore, in addition to multi-user diversity, the proposed method also exploits multi-access-point diversity and soft capacity. A polynomial time heuristic algorithm is then proposed to solve the optimization problem. Simulation results indicate a significant performance improvement in terms of packet-drop-ratio and achieved throughput.","['Keivan Navaie', 'Halim Yanikomeroglu']",50,"['0d90f37b-3aaa-4fc2-b3aa-0b4b1de24c10', '2e8af6ad-3dae-4a03-8ede-a1373759a231', '3fc884ae-c248-447a-823a-eeb24c868bd8', '6c2aa5ff-91f1-40cf-9c12-4e2f61003f24', '91a9102b-8c62-4ab4-be4f-3650a03b85f1', 'da3cc8f1-8907-4c89-8bbb-c6a7e73b36be', 'dd3151e6-9756-4260-bc37-3507976fa578']",Downlink Joint Base-station Assignment and Packet Scheduling Algorithm for Cellular CDMA/TDMA Networks,international conference on communications,2006,4afb5494-3395-4885-a803-53b957745cdd
"In wireless mobile ad-hoc networks, data packets have to be relayed hop by hop from a given source node to a destination node. This means that some or all of the mobile nodes must accept to forward information for the benefit of other nodes. It has been shown by F. Nait-Abdesselam, et al., (2003) that this ability of forwarding packets leads to a new unfairness problem in wireless ad-hoc networks, where a node which is forwarding other node's packets gets less bandwidth, for its own use, than a node which is not participating to the routing service. The proposed RAMAC scheme by F. Nait-Abdesselam, et al., (2003), has shown all its effectiveness to cope with this unfairness problem. However, an extra bandwidth is sometimes allowed to the routing node's own traffic comparing to other nonrouting node's own traffics, and the routing node's routed traffic gets much less bandwidth. This is explained by the fact that at the upper layer (for instance the IP layer) does not differentiate between the routing and the own traffics, and that the multiplicative factor used to compute the new contention window is too aggressive. In this paper, an enhanced RAMAC scheme is proposed, by taking into account the differentiation on top of the MAC layer, between the and routed traffics within a routing node, and by smoothing the multiplicative factor used to compute the new contention window. The simulation results obtained showed a good improvement of the original RAMAC scheme, leading to better approximate equal bandwidth share among all the mobile nodes in the wireless ad-hoc network.","['Farid Nait-Abdesselam', 'Hend Koubaa']",50,"['0b93552e-74e8-483f-82cb-5c04e1cd9232', '0e37e2f2-5d6d-4468-a3bd-589be2a4ada0', '185dfc84-5463-4022-b36f-7e95073d5042', '9663d55a-65e5-4e52-86ac-971e273c974d', 'e5b1a1f0-2804-484b-9b0d-ff0ddd0ed577']",Enhanced routing-aware adaptive MAC with traffic differentiation and smoothed contention window in wireless ad-hoc networks,international conference on distributed computing systems,2004,4afb6fce-fe7c-460a-96f0-6e3252dbff1f
"Marginal distributions play an central role in statistical analysis of a contingency table. However, when the number of partition becomes large, the contribution from marginal distributions decreases. This paper focuses on a formal analysis of marginal distributions in a contingency table. The main approach is to take the difference between two matrices with the same sample size and the same marginal distributions, which we call difference matrix. The important nature of the difference matrix is that the determinant is equal to 0: when the rank of a matrix is r, the difference between a original matrix and the expected matrix will become r - 1 at most. Since the sum of rows or columns of the will become zero, which means that the information of one rank corresponds to information on the frequency of a contingency matrix. Interestingly, if we take an expected matrix whose elements are the expected values based on marginal distributions, the difference between an original matrix and expected matrix can be represented by linear combination of determinants of 2 times 2 submatrices.","['Shusaku Tsumoto', 'Shoji Hirano']",13,"['2664e6f5-f948-4421-9f54-bebc4b40eeb4', '622bf22c-148b-4d96-8b06-5f3683b74d38', 'fae30747-2975-466a-b5de-5c7336d0a008']",Meaning of Pearson Residuals Linear Algebra View,granular computing,2007,4afb88ca-a749-4411-8ee1-59ac1d7b82f7

"Iterative flattening search (ifs) is an iterative improvement heuristic schema for makespan minimization in scheduling problems. Given an initial solution, ifsiteratively interleaves a relaxation-step, which randomly retracts some search decisions, and an incremental solving step (or flattening-step) to recompute a new solution. The process continues until a stop condition is met and the best solution found is returned. In recent work we have created a uniform software framework to analyze component techniques that have been proposed in ifsapproaches. In this paper we combine basic components to obtain hybrid variants and perform a detailed experimental evaluation of their performance. Specifically, we examine the utility of: (1) operating with different relaxation strategies and (2) using different searching strategies to built a new solution. We present a two-step experimental evaluation: (a) an extensive explorative evaluation with a spectrum of parameter combination; (b) a time-intensive evaluation of the best ifscombinations emerged from the previous. The experimental results shed light on weaknesses and strengths of the different variants improving the current understanding of this family of meta-heuristics.","['Angelo Oddi', 'Amedeo Cesta', 'Nicola Policella', 'Stephen F.

"This paper asks whether brand extension can serve as a signal of product quality given that it costs less than a new brand. (Existing literature has assumed either that brand extension is cost-neutral or that it costs more.) I show that it can as a perfect Bayesian equilibrium, but the argument is unconvincing. For one thing, the separating equilibrium is not unique; a pooling equilibrium also exists in which brand extension signals nothing. For another, the separating equilibrium relies on off-equilibrium beliefs that are poorly motivated in the model. I propose a refinement of the perfect Bayesian equilibrium that resolves both issues. Empirical off-equilibrium beliefs require that consumers' off-equilibrium beliefs be justifiable on the basis of their prior beliefs and product performance observations. With empirical off-equilibrium beliefs, two necessary conditions for brand extension to signal product quality are identified: (i) consumers must perceive old and new products of the firm to be positively correlated in quality, and (ii) at least some consumers must identify with brands and not the firm behind the brands. Even with these conditions in place, the signaling argument is fragile: firm observability of past performance diminishes brand extension's signaling capability; an arbitrarily small probability of failure for good products eliminates it. My results suggest that, going forward, the case for brand extension must rest on foundations other than signaling product quality.",['Sridhar Moorthy'],1,[],Can Brand Extension Signal Product Quality,Marketing Science,2012,4afc22c8-723f-42ee-845d-8cacb15552dc
"Studies of community structure and evolution in large social networks require a fast and accurate algorithm for community detection. As the size of analyzed communities grows, complexity of the community detection algorithm needs to be kept close to linear. The Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) has the benefits of nearly-linear running time and easy implementation, thus it forms a good basis for efficient community detection methods. In this paper, we propose new update rule and label propagation criterion in LPA to improve both its computational efficiency and the quality of communities that it detects. The speed is optimized by avoiding unnecessary updates performed by the original algorithm. This change reduces significantly (by order of magnitude for large networks) the number of iterations that the algorithm executes. We also evaluate our generalization of the LPA update rule that takes into account, with varying strength, connections to the neighborhood of a node considering a new label. Experiments on computer generated networks and a wide range of social networks show that our new rule improves the quality of the detected communities compared to those found by the original LPA. The benefit of considering positive neighborhood strength is pronounced especially on real-world networks containing sufficiently large fraction of nodes with high clustering coefficient.","['Jierui Xie', 'Boleslaw K.

The relaxed formulation and the algorithms were tested on small and moderate sized instances. It leads to values very close to the optimum solution values. The exact algorithm could obtain solutions for small and moderate sized instances, and the best heuristics obtained optimum or near optimum solutions for all tested instances. The semidefinite relaxation gives a lower bound C/W and each heuristic produces a cut S with a ratio c S /w S , where either c S  is at most a factor of C or w S  is at least a factor of W. We solved the semidefinite relaxation using a semi-infinite cut generation with a commercial linear programming package adapted to the sparsest cut problem.

"A comparison-based decoder detects the arrival of a code word by comparing the received checkbits with the checkbits computed using the received data. Implementation issues underlying comparison-based decoders for systematic delay-insensitive (DI) or unordered codes is the subject of this paper. We show that if the decoder is to be implemented using asynchronous logic, i.e., if the gate and wire delays are arbitrary (unbounded but finite), then it is impossible to design a comparison-based decoder for any code that is more efficient than a dual-rail code. In other words, the encoded word must contain at least twice as many bits as the data. In addition, the codes should satisfy two other properties, called the initial condition and the all-zero lower triangle (AZLT) property, for the realization of a delay-insensitive comparison-based decoder.

"Millimeter-wave (mmWave) transmissions are promising technologies for high data rate (multi-Gbps) Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPANs). In this paper, we first introduce the concept of exclusive region (ER) to allow concurrent transmissions to explore the spatial multiplexing gain of wireless networks. Considering the unique characteristics of mmWave communications and the use of omni-directional or directional antennae, we derive the ER conditions which ensure that concurrent transmissions can always outperform serial TDMA transmissions in a mmWave WPAN. We then propose REX, a randomized ER based scheduling scheme, to decide a set of senders that can transmit simultaneously. In addition, the expected number of flows that can be scheduled for concurrent transmissions is obtained analytically. Extensive simulations are conducted to validate the analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed REX scheduling scheme. The results should provide important guidelines for future deployment of mmWave based WPANs.","['Lin X. Cai', 'Lin Cai', 'Xuemin Shen', 'Jon W.

"This paper presents a method of using texture mapping with mipmapping to render a VLSI layout.  Texture mapping is used to save already rasterized areas of the layout from frame to frame, and to take advantage of any hardware accelerated capabilities of the host platform. Mipmapping is used to select which textures to display so that the amount of information sent to the display is bounded, and the image rendered on the display is filtered correctly.  Additionally, two caching schemes are employed.  The first, used to bound memory consumption, is a general purpose cache that holds textures spatially close to the user's current viewpoint. The second, used to speed up the rendering process, is a cache of heavily used sub-designs that are precomputed so rasterization on the fly is not necessary.  An experimental implementation shows that real-time navigation can be achieved on arbitrarily large designs. Results also show how this technique ensures that image quality does not degrade as the number of polygons drawn increases, avoiding the aliasing artifacts common in other layout systems.","['J. L.

"We consider the use of a relay to provide capacity improvements and range extension for in-home power line communication networks. In particular, we focus on opportunistic relaying where the relay is exploited only if it provides improved capacity w.r.t. the use of direct transmission between the source and the destination. The relay applies a decode and forward scheme and the channel is shared in a time division multiple access mode. The performance is studied in statistically representative in-home power line communication (PLC) networks via the use of a statistical topology model together with the application of transmission line theory for the computation of the channel transfer function among network nodes. The statistical topology model allows determining the capacity improvements as a function of the relay position. Furthermore, we determine the optimal time slot duration for each considered relay configuration, as well as we propose the use of a globally optimal time slot duration that maximizes the average network capacity. The numerical results show that significant capacity improvement can be obtained via opportunistic relaying in in-home PLC networks. The gains are more significant for low SNR scenarios and for networks composed by sub-networks each connected to the main panel via a circuit breaker that introduces signal attenuation.","['Andrea M.

"In this paper we suggest and compare the performance of different systems that can be used for wireless asynchronous transfer mode (WATM) to improve performance in terms of cell loss ratio and throughput under a certain fading wireless channel for a certain period of time. The type of fading considered in this paper is a result of a sudden and a sharp change in the signal level due to a sudden change in the weather condition (e.g. lightning) or due to a multipath effect caused by a mobile obstacle. It was found that compressing the ATM cell header and then applying the Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem BCH (i+18,i,3) code to the compressed header during the fading period, when the bit error rate ranges between 10/sup -3/ and 10/sup -1/, results in an optimum performance in terms of cell loss ratio and throughput.","['Mazen Al-Khatib', 'M.Z.

"Recently Web mining has become a hot research topic, which combines two of the prominent research areas comprising of data mining and the World Wide Web (WWW). Web usage mining attempts to discover useful knowledge from the secondary data obtained from the interactions of the users with the Web. Web usage mining has become very critical for effective Web site management, business and support services, personalization, network traffic flow analysis and so on. Our previous study on Web usage mining using a concurrent neuro-fuzzy approach has shown that the usage trend analysis very much depends on the performance of the clustering of the number of requests. In this paper, a novel approach 'intelligent-miner' (i-Miner) is introduced to optimize the concurrent architecture of a fuzzy clustering algorithm (to discover data clusters) and a fuzzy inference system to analyze the trends. In the concurrent neuro-fuzzy approach, self-organizing maps were used to cluster the Web user requests. A hybrid evolutionary FCM approach is proposed in this paper to optimally segregate similar user interests. The clustered data is then used to analyze the trends using a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system learned using a combination of evolutionary algorithm and neural network learning. Empirical results clearly shows that the proposed technique is efficient with lesser number of if-then rules and improved accuracy at the expense of complicated algorithms and extra computational cost.",['Ajith Abraham'],50,"['2fbd4cba-e697-4bbb-8923-490086e47284', '43428c25-b58f-4ab1-9479-33b4565f1049', '48972361-4ff5-4246-a71f-12b0b7ac7516', '5e0c1f79-5ba6-4c8b-bdaf-c203947530f1', 'b9113003-e28d-4dac-a980-ef6fe128b03f', 'c08ee43b-111a-4d2a-a224-b67fa4af8412', 'c2584c6c-d396-4724-97fb-f040d47b4751', 'e9c58903-de95-4a4a-8445-072e2ffb6c84']",i-Miner: a Web usage mining framework using hierarchical intelligent systems,ieee international conference on fuzzy systems,2003,4afda1bf-266a-4dd6-acb5-d3646f2ff05c

Most of tracking applications resort to only one source of information, making the system dependent on the source reliability. To achieve more robust and longer tracking, multiple source data fusion is a solution. Belief functions are a powerful tool for data fusion.

"Bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) has been adopted in many systems and standards for spectrally efficient coded transmission. The analytical evaluation of BICM performance parameters, in particular bit-error rate (BER), has received considerable attention in the recent past. In this paper, we derive BER approximations for BICM transmission over general fading channels impaired by Gaussian mixture noise (GMN). To this end, we build upon the saddlepoint approximation of the pairwise error probability (PEP) and a recently established approximation for the probability density function (PDF) of bit-wise reliability metrics for nonfading additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. We extend this PDF approximation to the case of GMN, and obtain closed-form expressions for its Laplace transform for fading GMN channels. The latter allows us to express the PEP and thus BER via the saddlepoint approximation. For the special case of fading AWGN channels the presented approximations are closed form, since the saddlepoint is well approximated by 1/2 for BICM decoding. Furthermore, we derive closed-form PEP expressions also for GMN channels in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime and establish the diversity and coding gain for BICM transmission over fading GMN channels. Selected numerical results for the BER of convolutional coded BICM highlight the usefulness of the proposed approximations and the differences between AWGN and GMN channels.","['Alireza Kenarsari-Anhari', 'Lutz Lampe']",29,"['20d45c4b-1637-4bde-9ab6-abbdff54e688', '2d65803d-9b50-4796-9cf3-4794f60ffb3d', '37f62192-28c2-4329-8395-38f06a71a1c6', '4978c720-d90c-486f-b8dc-95fcb7a4d6e2', '49cb1e68-a897-4ad8-8a99-a9529c8f1ec8', '52fd498c-00bd-4867-a950-f7b7d65ea075', '53e45487-6b0f-42a0-af25-114463f46de5', '5a0cbef5-d388-40e6-8023-4bfd99ab1815', '5b6ef43c-b8b5-4565-8b5f-76710cb34bfe', '5eab8e42-d796-4f8d-ae97-a1a82a3bfee9', '85646d4b-28ed-47e3-b5bf-ee3415d58eba', '87f9957b-2ac7-4090-b226-c4b3dd77e52a', '88fa103c-1538-44a5-850e-bcabd9c2ecf4', '8df9247b-f5a5-4580-b3ab-46e08286b93a', 'bf3f95f5-c214-4766-9985-74743ca21361', 'c352a55f-793e-4b02-8909-846a5378aac1', 'caeb80e3-6e9e-4a3e-93bd-c007680b15db', 'cf437a1c-19d2-4437-b7f1-5ed0cbc3bdd8', 'd2a76648-ce2e-42fb-8fa8-5a8025e70a8e', 'd555ba43-d2cc-4a80-ad4c-019dbdccb3ef', 'e94c5576-0680-4434-a447-b1478c106b44']",Performance Analysis for BICM Transmission over Gaussian Mixture Noise Fading Channels,IEEE Transactions on Communications,2010,4afdb5f9-cfe7-4775-b7e2-b33b922cbefa
"We report the implementation experience and experimental evaluation of a staggered adaptive forward error correction (FEC) system for video multicast over wireless LANs. In the system, the parity packets generated by a cross-packet FEC code are transmitted at a time delay from the original video packets, i.e. staggercasting video stream and FEC stream in different multicast groups. The delay provides temporal diversity to improve the robustness of video multicast, especially to enable the clients to correct burst packet loss using FEC and to achieve seamless handoff. A wireless client dynamically joins the FEC multicast groups based upon its channel conditions and handoff events. We have implemented the system including the streaming server and client proxy. A novel software architecture is designed to integrate the FEC functionality in the clients without requirement for changing the existing video player software. We conduct extensive experiments to investigate the impact of FEC overhead and the delay between the video stream and FEC stream to the video quality under different interference levels and mobile handoff durations. The efficacy of staggered adaptive FEC system on improving video multicast quality is demonstrated in real system implementation.","['Hang Liu', 'Mingquan Wu', 'Dekai Li', 'Saurabh Mathur', 'Kumar Ramaswamy', 'Liqiao Han', 'Dipankar Raychaudhuri']",9,"['137f38d4-4906-4898-b093-fd15df2a1a24', '6120ccc0-ac80-4c81-8448-eb1e980a0858', '941d0a2d-08b5-4fee-832e-638d627410c1', '9b8c22ef-d8f8-4e04-b911-410120125826', 'aeee4657-c53d-45fb-b222-d1d568257a93']",A Staggered FEC System for Seamless Handoff in Wireless LANs: Implementation Experience and Experimental Study,international symposium on multimedia,2007,4afdc5c1-f2ab-4dda-b9d4-38088d2eea25

"As decision-aiding tools become more popular everyday—but at the same time more sophisticated—it is of utmost importance to develop their explanatory capabilities. Some decisions require careful explanations, which can be challenging to provide when the underlying mathematical model is complex. This is the case when recommendations are based on incomplete expression of preferences, as the decision-aiding tool has to infer despite this scarcity of information. This step is key in the process but hardly intelligible for the user. The robust additive utility model is a necessary preference relation which makes minimal assumptions, at the price of handling a collection of compatible utility functions, virtually impossible to exhibit to the user. This strength for the model is a challenge for the explanation. In this paper, we come up with an explanation engine based on sequences of preference swaps, that is, pairwise comparison of alternatives. The intuition is to confront the decision maker with “elementary” comparisons, thus building incremental explanations. Elementary here means that alternatives compared may only differ on two criteria. Technically, our explanation engine exploits some properties of the necessary preference relation that we unveil in the paper. Equipped with this, we explore the issues of the existence and length of the resulting sequences. We show in particular that in the general case, no bound can be given on the length of explanations, but that in binary domains, the sequences remain short.","['Khaled Belahcene', 'Christophe Labreuche', 'Nicolas Maudet', 'Vincent Mousseau', 'Wassila Ouerdane']",50,"['1c4aa578-63cb-4fd0-b680-c53983ebda1b', '3635f652-bcbf-4d0b-95ec-29831a2d031d', '39317a51-3069-482f-aeeb-7b5117879523', '3fa467c8-9099-4505-a219-9368ad577e76', '4a08c61a-109c-426e-9593-22bb91ef3cbd', '56d40aa7-4f86-4085-86ec-8f2f88acdb76', '593100a2-8467-4498-ac71-affb80ec2f6f', '6675be5c-7655-4454-8930-fbb289ee8ff0', '822235e6-6abe-442b-b761-b51795df418a', '8ee057e3-64d4-4e7a-b2e8-b24c18c73c67', 'a9db0900-7c85-4c3c-ac21-05d814cf886d', 'c1dd0c33-f35d-466a-b1fe-2dc25211970c', 'ce882cb0-ce56-4231-ac84-d6de9ed6c8db', 'd4045bd6-8459-41bc-9cd2-be2fc749dd70', 'd51107b5-c6fd-4102-ab43-610f87ebde61', 'e6a71a4d-94e9-4703-a3ca-6657b4344a63', 'f149644a-f706-4053-bcc9-16d9476f3629', 'f1973170-fff6-4501-9309-ee419167614c', 'f820d65d-1ab2-4b93-baa0-d2a06744d269', 'fbfd0ac8-9674-42c9-9a32-58561940dfce']",Explaining robust additive utility models by sequences of preference swaps,Theory and Decision,2017,4afddd71-6bc6-40f7-aaa7-375c41b1d81e

This paper shows how to use the transformation of Paterson and Hewitt to improve the memory and operations used in a pointer algorithm. That transformation scheme normally is only of theoretical interest because of the inefficient performance of the transformed function. However we present a method how it can be used to decrease the amount of selective updates in memory while preserving the original runtime performance. This leads to a general transformation framework for the derivation of a class of pointer algorithms.,['Thorsten Ehm'],50,"['0278ccc8-b64a-4d37-b51d-3337288266e0', '3c500b4d-5fd3-4b10-a9d4-728963ab0b4b', '5474b19e-989f-444f-aa21-397d8b704bc7', '6326f76e-9eff-47c6-9479-0d0198fe97d8', '79b41779-f27b-4009-b682-91b2a15d9d43', '87d340b8-8449-4fed-b93a-92d3aeb46f59', '903a10d8-597f-4278-b107-e0aaa51cb17d', 'e09b42bd-b4b3-4817-ae97-145c100bc40f']",Transformational Construction of Correct Pointer Algorithms,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2001,4afe2442-48d4-46ad-acb1-1216cc04fb8a

"Outsourcing of software development tasks has become a major issue for large software enterprises over the last decades. Nowadays, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) follow this trend and outsource parts of their software development as well. However, most of the existing literature deals with large enterprises whereas the situation of SMEs is being neglected. Especially sourcing decisions and the organizational as well as operational setup may differ between large enterprises and SMEs. We choose an exploratory multiple-case study approach focusing on the German software market in order to shed light on these aspects of the sourcing behavior of SMEs. This paper addresses three complementing research questions. Besides the question of which phases of the software development process qualify for outsourcing, we explore the organizational setup of SMEs' outsourcing scenarios. In addition, we seek to find out which characteristics a software component has to fulfill in order to qualify for outsourcing.","['Tommi Kramer', 'Lars Klimpke', 'Armin Heinzl']",0,"['1016a61c-a188-408a-9d65-c415e2521fe0', '1293e572-ef57-41a3-8fc2-a000455f542c', '1656206d-2d20-4704-adc6-38371370ef60', '3aeb2705-2ac1-49c5-8cfc-fa161b00920e', '3ddf8245-810b-4404-881d-921589dd4e42', '4220fddb-5daa-496d-8980-3a97f7a18720', '4e5b728a-f4fd-43d1-bdc9-9dff584dbdcd', '55b86252-b20e-4e1a-a41d-5658dd9bef0f', '5827c8e8-a4c3-4eb9-83a0-1df665ed003b', '5a1d1ae4-b359-45d9-8c21-50cbfa5e2a78', '6efed895-54b5-4ade-9a13-6ac63bacdbd8', '8529a0cd-9bb0-4f4e-a8b9-4de3881c9fde', '859c303d-cd23-4ce0-80bb-ecaffbdfdb5c', '94b927f3-b3c9-4799-aa8a-4aa0d6e8b7c8', '987e7c67-0a82-4890-8467-2d2a9c75ab47', 'c6fc9cc1-67c7-4f64-a4cc-a1671f45d9f5', 'd7077f46-de7d-4cee-a6f5-402b8d9e4e3a', 'dd22d555-c9af-4e02-a2bc-ef7557916320', 'de7826c3-df33-490e-bd1b-64b68c0c5084', 'e6f9e117-195c-4075-b6ba-7089420fa249', 'f8acc004-58e4-4de0-8ced-a133925b6d44', 'feac433b-2650-4044-b83c-ca4689fa8674']",Outsourcing Decisions of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises: A Multiple-Case Study Approach in the German Software Industry,hawaii international conference on system sciences,2013,4afe2bea-f5ce-48bc-b99c-116c56b45f5d
"In this paper, a new sparse approximation technique is proposed for incremental power grid analysis. Our proposed method is motivated by the observation that when a power grid network is locally updated during circuit design, its response changes locally and, hence, the incremental ""change"" of the power grid voltage is almost zero at many internal nodes, resulting in a unique sparse pattern. An efficient Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm is adopted to solve the proposed sparse approximation problem. In addition, several numerical techniques are proposed to improve the numerical stability of the proposed solver, while simultaneously maintaining its high efficiency. Several industrial circuit examples demonstrate that when applied to incremental power grid analysis, our proposed approach achieves up to 130× runtime speed-up over the traditional Algebraic Multi-Grid (AMG) method, without surrendering any accuracy.","['Pei Sun', 'Xin Li', 'Ming Yuan Ting']",50,"['0d8b2812-8029-421c-a0dd-0555a8fa4267', '12074b52-351b-4551-8c13-c3ebbcab55b9', '17f1d08a-c5a4-4d9f-965d-542960f1993f', '2d9ebb75-6325-4cc5-974b-543b6be401d1', '311494ca-6ce1-480e-957d-9396a9da649c', '41d3b775-b602-4345-ab99-2282b8b25b3e', '69b9ef96-11d5-49b0-9ae3-492763e02ca8', '737cd935-b5b5-4744-b3c7-63ff5e8b7999', '770637eb-4539-4628-a8ec-c2c7a37fdc43', '8227abbf-2657-453f-a11a-8d85d211308d', '9e0e0e80-8005-492c-9f9a-2ae9f1fe1bb2', 'a1659e9b-5dae-45ee-87f4-070213c4ab0c', 'be6b1ae3-0144-41f4-9215-864332bf1f53', 'd4a27a14-b4b5-41c0-84ee-6338d98ffa8a', 'ead23896-e16b-46cf-9e33-6009d89da910', 'effff51b-366f-4c08-a69e-10164409201c', 'f4233e6f-6365-46b5-8021-dfebf3a5e9f3', 'f56b877b-4060-4754-b303-e8140968544c']",Efficient incremental analysis of on-chip power grid via sparse approximation,design automation conference,2011,4afe2d4c-e2ff-4f33-8ff4-6fc9bd406b6a

Its graphical notation is based on the LCARS design, which is appealing to different target groups, based on their specific interests and requirements. We show that users can easily create pervasive applications using an LCARS-based user interface. The first step is to describe the technical context in which the application will execute. Based on this technical context, the UI offers a context-specific set of visual primitives. By composing these visual primitives on the screen, the user can specify the behavior of the application.","['Andreas Heil', 'Iman Moradi', 'Torben Weis']",3,"['83726951-6d9d-4ca7-9984-2d45575e96e1', 'c42194e2-315d-42af-9133-d50facebe139']",LCARS: the next generation programming context,advanced visual interfaces,2006,4afe40c3-e678-4257-a1a6-5088f029b667
"Local part-based human detectors are capable of handling partial occlusions efficiently and modeling shape articulations flexibly, while global shape template-based human detectors are capable of detecting and segmenting human shapes simultaneously. We describe a Bayesian approach to human detection and segmentation combining local part-based and global template-based schemes. The approach relies on the key ideas of matching a part-template tree to images hierarchically to generate a reliable set of detection hypotheses and optimizing it under a Bayesian MAP framework through global likelihood re-evaluation and fine occlusion analysis. In addition to detection, our approach is able to obtain human shapes and poses simultaneously. We applied the approach to human detection and segmentation in crowded scenes with and without background subtraction. Experimental results show that our approach achieves good performance on images and video sequences with severe occlusion.","['Zhe Lin', 'Larry S. Davis', 'David S.

"Abstract#R##N##R##N#While technology has the potential to create opportunities for transformative learning in higher education, it is often used to merely reinforce didactic teaching that aims to control access to expert knowledge. Instead, educators should consider using technology to enhance communication and provide richer, more meaningful platforms for the social construction of knowledge. By using technology to engage in shared learning experiences that extend beyond the walls of the classroom, we can create opportunities to develop the patterns of thinking that students need to participate in complex, real world situations. We used authentic learning as a framework to guide the implementation of a case-based, blended module in a South African physiotherapy department. Google Drive was used as a collaborative online authoring environment in which small groups of students used clinical cases to create their own content, guided by a team of facilitators. This paper describes an innovative approach to clinical education using authentic learning as a guiding framework, and Google Drive as an implementation platform. We believe that this approach led to the transformation of student learning practices, altered power relationships in the classroom and facilitated the development of critical attitudes towards knowledge and authority.","['Michael Rowe', 'Vivienne Bozalek', 'Jose M.

"There has been an increasing interest in using star topologies in field-bus communications, e.g., in Time Triggered Protocol for SAE classC applications (TTP/C), FlexRay, or controller area network (CAN), due to increased fault resilience and potential error-containment advantages. In this context, an innovative CAN-compliant star topology, CANcentrate, has been developed, whose hub includes enhanced fault-treatment mechanisms. However, despite this interest toward stars, it is still necessary to quantify their real dependability benefits. For this purpose and for the particular case of CAN, this paper presents models for the dependability features of CAN and CANcentrate using Stochastic Activity Networks (SANs). It quantitatively compares their reliability and error-containment capabilities under permanent hardware faults. These models rely on assumptions that ensure that results are not biased toward CANcentrate, which, in some cases, is too detrimental for it. Thus, despite not reflecting the full CANcentrate potential, results quantitatively confirm the improvement of error-containment it achieves over CAN. Additionally, the way in which the nodes' ability to contain their own errors affects the relevance of using a star topology has been quantified. Although this paper refers to the case of CAN, conclusions regarding the justification of using a star topology depending on this ability can be extrapolated to other field-bus technologies.","['Manuel Barranco', 'Julian Proenza', 'Luis Almeida']",50,"['058360f3-2537-440c-afd5-2091ef1a9fb8', '0d39dbe9-a2ed-4755-ba75-b43655552eba', '0f0dafa1-65bd-4cfb-b127-110abcd53aa0', '117b123e-12dd-4786-8f34-0298c1b472bc', '18939c79-3133-489f-8187-ff47e874a3d2', '1e070d65-fbea-49d1-96b7-8d8b4bb2273b', '1e6ddd81-536e-4719-94b6-81e49d334997', '250ac8cf-7f81-4e2b-82d6-5699fc66d668', '35b2504e-60ce-4228-9368-81643f3cecfe', '44736d68-e24f-45bb-9300-ff65f9ca2723', '6280466d-0561-4fb8-98ca-8c12abe0a7dd', '68692e57-a453-4db4-9c94-61a772a6b737', '68fc74f7-2be5-4b65-99ed-ea0dcfd0dacf', '7284d817-a7fc-4e11-9a4a-dc7eed094ec0', '88800157-320d-4148-8cc9-13c44278539f', 'a51f21c0-33ef-49f2-9c73-8ec73d504363', 'd2fd3b93-55fb-45e4-8f6d-e3d79b05bc11', 'dc0b9ac5-b710-457e-8b54-565935c5632a', 'fd6078d0-a63a-4ee1-b8f4-1a9a40a075df']",Quantitative Comparison of the Error-Containment Capabilities of a Bus and a Star Topology in CAN Networks,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2011,4afe51ea-47eb-4a53-ab59-984d43722838
"Analysis and design of a single-stage  LLC  resonant converter are proposed. A single-stage converter uses only one control signal to drive two power converters, a power factor corrector (PFC) converter and a dc/dc converter, for reducing the cost of the system. However, this simplicity induces power imbalance between two converters, and then, the bus voltage between two converters drifts and becomes unpredictable. To ensure that the bus capacitor voltage can be kept in a tolerable region, the characteristics of a PFC converter and an  LLC  tank are investigated, and then, a design procedure is proposed correspondingly. Finally, a single-stage  LLC  resonant converter is implemented to verify the analysis.","['Shih-Yu Chen', 'Zhu Rong Li', 'Chern-Lin Chen']",8,"['52c2019e-bad5-4516-8f3f-4539836e94d7', '6e6f291a-7907-4d00-bdfa-a20e2840cb0c', 'be37e6a8-0929-43d1-bb2b-3a28d68d78b6', 'debb632d-53d0-4d4a-999b-5f5ac709324b', 'ecd4babd-5431-46bb-8625-5b9874fd083d', 'f0b6c869-dff1-49b5-99d2-188a2d0e3199']",Analysis and Design of Single-Stage AC/DC $LLC$ Resonant Converter,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2012,4afe9674-4105-448d-b599-12403d2888f5

Finally, the criteria are applied to a fabricated and flight tested small scale high efficiency aircraft prototype to determine the optimal battery and photovoltaic array mass for robust continuous flight.","['Scott Morton', 'Luke Scharber', 'Nikolaos Papanikolopoulos']",14,"['3eb81fce-7e25-45d3-b471-f73f45506a96', '4282def6-3468-4346-b568-75e1dccdd5c1', '7f8c9fa2-8974-440d-a653-720d6662f228', 'b0931608-c654-49ff-ab1a-9babb3753df9', 'b4e99078-1233-4b09-9c5f-e148177e404e', 'cf52dc9e-a934-4ce0-bfb0-e677c5649944', 'f723f330-f976-4661-992d-1fd5780f61dd', 'f8a2738a-a149-435a-8387-6265be467c2c']",Solar powered unmanned aerial vehicle for continuous flight: Conceptual overview and optimization,international conference on robotics and automation,2013,4afec1df-a16b-4771-aa7a-cda509b2378b
This work describes the analysis of different walking paths registered using a Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) laser range sensor in order to measure oscillating trajectories during unsupervised walking. The estimate of the gait and trajectory parameters were obtained with a terrestrial LIDAR placed 100 mm above the ground with the scanning plane parallel to the floor to measure the trajectory of the legs without attaching any markers or modifying the floor. Three different large walking experiments were performed to test the proposed measurement system with straight and oscillating trajectories. The main advantages of the proposed system are the possibility to measure several steps and obtain average gait parameters and the minimum infrastructure required. This measurement system enables the development of new ambulatory applications based on the analysis of the gait and the trajectory during a walk.,"['Mercè Teixidó', 'Tomàs Pallejà', 'Marcel Tresanchez', 'Miquel Nogués', 'Jordi Palacín']",50,"['14aa584e-19bb-4f4f-a8eb-c342ebacf905', '511f9f11-de64-4b4d-9c6b-b78fa7c20eec', '7a3b5ab9-3f4a-47b0-94b1-52397cd2497a', '8553f82e-487e-4d57-be72-4da7b5c44dfb', '97cb4724-5c14-4202-91c1-a9226990f5f2', 'd0b4a425-fe74-4e90-acff-2920fff181a6', 'd990437d-76c6-4537-9a9d-638d53a6e067']",Measuring Oscillating Walking Paths with a LIDAR,Sensors,2011,4afee73f-9ab6-4d1e-b1b3-ed0069181c36
Recently introduced methods of iterative identification and control design are directed towards the design of high performing and robust control systems. These methods show the necessity of identifying approximate models from closed loop plant experiments. In this paper a method is proposed to approximately identify normalized coprime plant factors from closed loop data. The fact that normalized plant factors are estimated gives specific advantages both from an identification and from a robust control design point of view. It will be shown that the proposed method leads to identified models that are specifically accurate around the bandwidth of the closed loop system. The identification procedure fits very naturally into a recently developed the iterative identification/control design scheme based on H∞ robustness optimization.,"['Paul M. J.

"Automatic Identification System (AIS) has to be on board in every ship over 500 gross tonnages (GT) in Japan from July 1, 2008. This is a response of amendment of maritime relating laws in accordance with SOLAS (International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea) Convention and IMO (International Maritime Organization) requires all ships over 500 GT or upward are fitted with ship borne AIS. AIS is a system which makes it possible to get precise on-line information from a large area about ships and their movements. AIS is based on a ship borne radio wave of VHF, it continuously and automatically transmits fixed, dynamic and voyage-related information and receives corresponding information from other ships near by. VTS (Vessel Transport Service) is provided by collection of AIS information from ships. Most of the VTS stations around the area of Gulf of Finland have equipped with coastal surveillance system with radar for early warnings to endangering ships. Combinations of AIS and VTS, in addition, practical lane-separation system have also been activated under international agreement of Russia, Estonia and Finland. These three systems are well combined and organised then significant effects of reducing risks of ship borne accidents have been observed. Practices of Gulf of Finland should be introduced other congested sea lanes.",['Nobuhiro Sawano'],1,,Current Situation of Digitalized Ship Navigation System for Safety,advanced information networking and applications,2008,4aff9c77-4ac9-419b-bd6f-8d5ee372cf1a
"The inference of gene predictors in the gene regulatory network (GRN) has become an important research area in the genomics and medical disciplines. Accurate predicators are necessary for constructing the GRN model and to enable targeted biological experiments that attempt to validate or control the regulation process. In this paper, we implement a SAT-based algorithm to determine the gene predictor set from steady state gene expression data (attractor states). Using the attractor states as input, the states are ordered into attractor cycles. For each attractor cycle ordering, all possible predictors are enumerated and a conjunctive normal form (CNF) expression is generated which encodes these predictors and their biological constraints. Each CNF is solved using a SAT solver to find candidate predictor sets. Statistical analysis of the resulting predictor sets selects the most likely predictor set of the GRN, corresponding to the attractor data. We demonstrate our algorithm on attractor state data from a melanoma study [1] and present our predictor set results.","['Pey-Chang Kent Lin', 'Sunil P.

"The widely used procedure of evaluation of cup orientation following THA using single standard anteroposterior radiograph is known inaccurate, largely due to the wide variability in individual pelvic position relative to X-ray plate. 3D-2D image registration methods have been introduced to estimate the transformation between a CT volume and the radiograph for an accurate estimation of the cup orientation relative to an anatomical reference extracted from the CT data. However, the robustness of these methods is questionable. This paper presents a robust image similarity measure which is derived from a variational approximation to mutual information and allows for incorporation of spatial information via energy minimization.

"Shrinkage is a well known and appealing denoising technique. The use of shrinkage is known to be optimal for Gaussian white noise, provided that the sparsity on the signals representation is enforced using a unitary transform. Still, shrinkage is also practiced successfully with nonunitary, and even redundant representations. In this paper we shed some light on this behavior. We show that simple shrinkage could be interpreted as the first iteration of an algorithm that solves the basis pursuit denoising (BPDN) problem. Thus, this work leads to a novel iterative shrinkage algorithm that can be considered as an effective pursuit method. We demonstrate this algorithm, both on synthetic data, and for the image denoising problem, where we learn the image prior parameters directly from the given image. The results in both cases are superior to several popular alternatives.","['Michael Elad', 'Boaz Matalon', 'Michael Zibulevsky']",97,"['31c883b9-75b1-4ea6-b9e2-776cc33a287f', '3d414a5e-b97a-498e-8a75-920997235c6b', '4a4cdb63-5e57-4011-84d0-d18f851962aa', '592f4278-aa82-4c43-9026-c4e180500dcb', '5fedb8b5-e278-447d-931a-c0557216a939', '7bc79cdf-8049-4c00-b2d4-fb87730fe6b0', 'ab0bfa8d-80b6-47ef-8a91-febce2ce65c5', 'aecf8a08-eff7-4182-8bbb-a7b29de2f281', 'b55670f3-3025-457e-9bd8-06930a1b3e74', 'ca40fe4e-f587-49df-b456-c16cf6d14f83', 'cb854215-9174-462a-8b53-ea596b217f5e', 'd11c6a56-fc23-4642-b394-99fd3aec953a', 'e2fdf670-0454-4ed4-9663-67b0502d1a0d']",Image Denoising with Shrinkage and Redundant Representations,computer vision and pattern recognition,2006,4b00142e-0e50-4245-9094-8d0108a68582

To this end, we first demonstrate that a robot controlled by a causal PD is globally input-to-state stable (ISS) with respect to a bounded input disturbance. Then, we prove that the addition of a feedforward compensation renders the error system uniformly globally asymptotically stable. Furthermore, we present a possible extension to more general nonlinear systems and also to uncertain systems.","['Eduardo V. L.

"Distributed search problems are ubiquitous in Artificial Life (ALife). Many distributed search problems require identifying a rare and previously unseen event and producing a rapid response. This challenge amounts to finding and removing an unknown needle in a very large haystack. Traditional computational search models are unlikely to find, nonetheless, appropriately respond to, novel events, particularly given data distributed across multiple platforms in a variety of formats and sources with variable and unknown reliability. Biological systems have evolved solutions to distributed search and response under uncertainty. Immune systems and ant colonies efficiently scale up massively parallel search with automated response in highly dynamic environments, and both do so using distributed coordination without centralized control. These properties are relevant to ALife, where distributed, autonomous, robust and adaptive control is needed to design robot swarms, mobile computing networks, computer security systems and other distributed intelligent systems. They are also relevant for searching, tracking the spread of ideas, and understanding the impact of innovations in online social networks. We review design principles for Scalable Robust, Adaptive, Decentralized search with Automated Response (Scalable RADAR) in biology. We discuss how biological RADAR scales up efficiently, and then discuss in detail how modular search in the immune system can be mimicked or built upon in ALife. Such search mechanisms are particularly useful when components have limited capacity to communicate and when physical distance makes communication more costly.","['Melanie E.

"Distributed computing environments have evolved from in-house clusters to Grids and now Cloud platforms. We, as others, provide HPC benchmarks results over Amazon EC2 that show a lower performance of Cloud resources compared to private resources., So, it is not yet clear how much of impact Clouds will have in high performance computing (HPC). But hybrid Grid/Cloud computing may offer opportunities to increase overall applications performance, while benefiting from in-house computational resources extending them by Cloud ones only whenever needed. In this paper, we advocate the usage of Proactive, a well established middleware in the grid community, for mixed Grid/Cloud computing, extended with features to address Grid/Cloud issues with little or, no effort for application developers. We also introduce a framework, developed in the context of the Disco Grid project, based upon the Proactive middleware to couple HPC domain-decomposition SPMD applications in heterogeneous multi-domain environments. Performance results, coupling Grid and Cloud resources for the execution of such, kind of highly communicating and processing intensive applications, have shown an overhead of about 15%, which is a non-negligible value, but lower enough to consider using such environments to achieve a better cost-performance trade-off than using exclusively Cloud resources.","['Brian Amedro', 'Françoise Baude', 'Fabrice Huet', 'Elton N.

"As scientific data sets grow exponentially in size, the need for scalable algorithms that heuristically partition the data increases. In this paper, we describe the three-step evolution of a hierarchical partitioning algorithm for large-scale spatio-temporal scientific data sets generated by massive simulations. The first version of our algorithm uses a simple top-down partitioning technique, which divides the data by using a four-way bisection of the spatio-temporal space. The shortcomings of this algorithm lead to the second version of our partitioning algorithm, which uses a bottom-up approach. In this version, a partition hierarchy is constructed by systematically agglomerating the underlying Cartesian grid that is placed on the data. Finally, the third version of our algorithm utilizes the intrinsic topology of the data given in the original scientific problem to build the partition hierarchy in a bottom-up fashion. Specifically, the topology is used to heuristically agglomerate the data at each level of the partition hierarchy. Despite the growing complexity in our algorithms, the third version of our algorithm builds partition hierarchies in less time and is able to build trees for larger size data sets as compared to the previous two versions.","['Chuck Baldwin', 'Tina Eliassi-Rad', 'Ghaleb Abdulla', 'Terence Critchlow']",11,"['4e0809ea-8570-45a9-915c-1990d2738205', '5596d5cf-16a5-40d1-a4f3-e8e258478d4e', 'ab303706-3c44-43a4-bf7d-bbc746b64d37']",The evolution of a hierarchical partitioning algorithm for large-scale scientific data: three steps of increasing complexity,statistical and scientific database management,2003,4b00d3b9-9bbe-46d2-a405-30a294d8104f
"We address special cases of a question of Eisenbud on the ideals of secant varieties of Veronese re-embeddings of arbitrary varieties. Eisenbud's question generalizes a conjecture of Eisenbud, Koh and Stillman (EKS) for curves. We prove that set-theoretic equations of small secant varieties to a high degree Veronese re-embedding of a smooth variety are determined by equations of the ambient Veronese variety and linear equations. However this is false for singular varieties, and we give explicit counter-examples to the EKS conjecture for singular curves. The techniques we use also allow us to prove a gap and uniqueness theorem for symmetric tensor rank. We put Eisenbud's question in a more general context about the behaviour of border rank under specialisation to a linear subspace, and provide an overview of conjectures coming from signal processing and complexity theory in this context.","['Jarosław Buczyński', 'Adam Ginensky', 'J.

It is based on partitioning uniformly quantized wavelet coefficients into multiscale blocks with each block classified as either an all-zero block or a non-zero block.

"Cosmic rays lead to soft errors and faulty behavior in electronic circuits. Knowing about their faulty behavior before fabrication would be helpful. This research proposes an approach for modeling the faulty behaviour of digital circuits. It could be applied in a design flow before circuit fabrication. This is achieved by extracting information about faulty behaviour of circuits from low-level models expressed in the VHDL language. Afterwards the extracted information is used to train high-level artificial neural networks models expressed in C/C++ or MATLAB TM  languages. The trained neural network models are able to replicate the behaviour of circuits in presence of faults. The methodology is based on experiments done with two benchmarks, the ISCAS-C17 and a 4-bit multiplier. Results show that the neural network approach leads to models that are more accurate than a previously reported signature generation method. For the C17, using only 30% of the dataset generated with the LIFTING fault simulator, the neural network is able to replicate the output of the circuit in presence of faults with a mean absolute modeling error below 6%.","['Zeynab Mirzadeh', 'Jean-François Boland', 'Yvon Savaria']",0,"['0ca996c1-4bd6-4a53-827b-9e7547b18821', '0f085706-516e-4333-a95c-e238e0d50d2e', '15d9cd7c-bf59-4fa2-8076-dd0d2e395006', '22cafd93-8bf7-4734-97f3-d643e7f1e1f7', '28d3dca5-e99e-498f-bd1f-81ac1e46b37c', '378903d7-a9d0-48a2-9552-f97521e688b2', '4aaa373d-ccf1-4c6e-b830-1460e64e685f', '54f0b04a-1d4d-4442-b823-201ef772dc95', '6b50c74c-4c45-4dab-8e25-29ad88a1535f', '7440c562-0f60-4865-ac9c-68c0a54a2376', '8b46009d-d7f0-4a25-af30-d38874828439', 'a9de0cc9-7b2d-46f7-be44-f2700351fc80', 'f8d6a45d-364e-4fb0-b6f4-39bd585fae45']",Modeling the faulty behaviour of digital designs using a feed forward neural network approach,international symposium on circuits and systems,2015,4b01beed-73b8-4b6f-add9-b099edaf03d2
"We consider distributed estimation of a deterministic vector parameter from noisy sensor observations in a wireless sensor network (WSN). The observation noise is assumed uncorrelated across sensors. To meet stringent power and bandwidth budgets inherent in WSNs, local data dimensionality reduction is performed at each sensor to reduce the number of messages sent to a fusion center (FC). The problem of interest is to jointly design the compression matrices associated with those sensors, aiming at minimizing the estimation error at the FC. Such a dimensionality reduction problem is investigated in this paper. Specifically, we study a homogeneous environment where all sensors have identical noise covariance matrices and an inhomogeneous environment where the noise covariance matrices across the sensors have the same correlation structure but with different scaling factors. Given a total number of messages sent to the FC, theoretical lower bounds on the estimation error of any compression strategy are derived for both cases. Compression strategies are developed to approach or even attain the corresponding theoretical lower bounds. Performance analysis and simulations are carried out to illustrate the optimality and effectiveness of the proposed compression strategies.","['Jun Fang', 'Hongbin Li']",50,"['0dbd2735-2753-4936-80e3-bd8648451ee6', '187f945a-0243-464d-8d69-fb5626bf7edd', '1d046c9a-6376-46be-a8f5-6d76dfa34e23', '2401355e-3930-425f-b0f2-9b50731fd180', '482f6a89-b58a-4232-b5ed-f490f0e337a8', '49523880-17b7-4aea-85c3-c6c1cbc75684', '4ec48f16-02dc-47c7-a6dd-a347a8c14c12', '52036b54-7007-4e46-89a6-4eb25ee5520c', '6ba95575-e35b-4473-b2bd-6597628275ed', '8bcd3774-e34c-44ad-a2f2-3376c5849582', '8e9bc773-fef4-4e7d-b5aa-e97a13aac76f', '9d4f692f-c96b-4602-b86d-30f896048055', '9e6c1d94-8c91-4ded-88d8-cfd43927a818', 'b5828a04-fd5c-48bc-a5ab-fe6f622b4784', 'c4cec1cd-3adb-4e81-b5f3-4887784fce37', 'c5b14c63-099c-44bc-a8f7-da9585d473f7', 'e073848a-51a6-4d19-ac4c-97a38b8d260f', 'eea0bb3d-6702-48cb-9021-533ffd070313', 'f36fdcda-6561-4073-acf0-eed52a0cc5b1']",Optimal/Near-Optimal Dimensionality Reduction for Distributed Estimation in Homogeneous and Certain Inhomogeneous Scenarios,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing,2010,4b01ea24-de78-46df-b26d-fdb08507dacb

Moreover, the induced equilibria are Pareto efficient and max-min fair.

"In clustered networks of wireless sensor motes, each mote collects noisy observations of the environment, quantizes these observations into a local estimate of finite length, and forwards them through one or more noisy wireless channels to the Cluster Head (CH). The measurement noise is assumed to be zero-mean and have finite variance. Each wireless hop is assumed to be a Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC) with a known crossover probability. We propose a novel scheme that uses dithered quantization and channel compensation to ensure that each motes' local estimate received by the CH is unbiased. The CH then fuses these unbiased local estimates into a global one using a Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE). The energy allocation problem at each mote and among different sensor motes are also discussed. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve much smaller mean square error (MSE) than two other common schemes while using the same amount of energy. The sensitivity of the proposed scheme to errors in estimates of the crossover probability of the BSC channel is studied by both analysis and simulation.","['Xusheng Sun', 'Edward J.

"Product derivation is an essential part of the Software Product Line (SPL) development process. The paperproposes a model transformation for deriving automatically a UML model of a specific product from the UML model of a product line. This work is a part of a larger project aiming to integrate performance analysis in the SPL model-driven development. The SPL source model is expressed in UML extended with two separate profiles: a ""product line"" profile from literature for specifying the commonality and variability between products, and the MARTE profile recently standardized by OMG for performance annotations. The automatic derivation of a concrete product model based on a given feature configuration is enabled through the mapping between features from the feature model and their realizations in the design model. The paper proposes an efficient mapping technique that aims to minimize the amount of explicit feature annotations in the UML design model of SPL. Implicit feature mapping is inferred during product derivation from the relationships between annotated and non-annotated model elements as defined in the UML metamodel and well formedness rules. The transformation is realized in the Atlas Transformation Language (ATL) and illustrated with an ecommerce case study that models structural and behavioural SPL views.","['Rasha Tawhid', 'Dorina C.

"Students in two different courses at a major research university (one a Communication course, the other a Computer Science course) were given laptop computers with wireless network access during the course of a semester. Students’ Web browsing on these laptops (including: URLs, dates, and times) was recorded 24 hours/day, 7 days/week in a log file by a proxy server during most of a semester (about 15 weeks). For each student, browsing behavior was quantified and then correlated with academic performance. The emergence of statistically significant results suggests that quantitative characteristics of browsing behavior—even prior to examining browsing content—can be useful predictors of meaningful behavioral outcomes. Variables such as Number of browsing sessions and Length of browsing sessions were found to correlate with students’ final grades; the valence and magnitude of these correlations were found to interact with Course (i.e., whether student was enrolled in the Communication or Computer Science course), Browsing Context (i.e., setting in which browsing took place: during class, on the wireless network between classes, or at home) and Gender.

In this paper we will jointly design the transceiver and bit allocation for maximizing bit rate. By using a high bit rate assumption, we will see that the optimal transceiver and bit allocation can be obtained in a closed form using simple Hadamard inequality and the Poincare separation theorem. In the simulation, we will demonstrate the usefulness of the joint design.

"Privacy and personalization of mobile experiences are inherently in conflict: better personalization demands knowing more about the user, potentially violating user privacy. A promising approach to mitigate this tension is to migrate personalization to the client, an approach dubbed  client-side personalization . This paper advocates for  operating system support  for client-side personalization and describes MoRePriv, an operating system  service  implemented in the Windows Phone OS. We argue that personalization support should be as ubiquitous as location support, and should be provided by a unified system within the OS, instead of by individual apps.   We aim to provide a solution that will stoke innovation around mobile personalization. To enable easy application personalization, MoRePriv approximates users' interests using  personae  such as technophile or business executive. Using a number of case studies and crowd-sourced user studies, we illustrate how more complex personalization tasks can be achieved using MoRePriv.   For privacy protection, MoRePriv distills sensitive user information to a coarse-grained  profile , which limits the potential damage from information leaks. We see MoRePriv as a way to increase end-user privacy by enabling client-side computing, thus minimizing the need to share user data with the server. As such, MoRePriv shepherds the ecosystem towards a better privacy stance by  nudging  developers away from today's privacy-violating practices. Furthermore, MoRePriv can be  combined  with privacy-enhancing technologies and is complimentary to recent advances in data leak detection.","['Drew Davidson', 'Matthew Fredrikson', 'Benjamin Livshits']",50,"['0052ef5e-d9a3-4e21-9b51-06e3fd063505', '0067011d-0ba8-4987-9aa3-cc4f5fa4f83a', '00f4c1d6-7224-4c69-8bf7-08f1478594dc', '076d63d8-7fd0-4fa4-819d-01e3a027b389', '09b1c7f5-54fa-41e5-8a71-6fee533464ed', '18fa1c9b-e31d-48e4-a70a-252f0231d9d7', '2fe7f7ee-5d8a-4711-aa31-1c026a9ce9e1', '3d1484a5-817f-4c65-a8a5-b551c47d00f0', '4c52a9c7-6baf-4a97-89a9-45ec31575ff3', '5cedd2cf-4b0b-4e66-98c8-651b7d3f43da', '5d0e567b-ac4b-42b6-bd30-ae4a0397bd76', '76d4cc9f-d3ad-43dd-a05c-f05eff3d1b18', '83dd4552-f05e-4388-a928-bcaa1f4deb81', '85dd7bd4-86cc-450c-bbe9-9facdc244ad8', '8846816b-9b7b-406a-b468-fc7e10a51e0c', '959c911e-9ff4-4981-97f9-152686545909', 'aa991af1-7413-49bf-9b45-eab5560df4fe', 'acd88b37-d8e4-4554-90db-bb0f04b68c5e', 'b3119951-82e8-4698-ae07-45179bfffa8f', 'b5a2b585-be87-4b1a-8fba-a5819248b59a', 'b6b1fe84-b142-44af-83be-e0ecfbe91bb2', 'bdd62299-6c94-4e4f-b2f4-cfae5df8e369', 'c6f01cff-73d6-4abf-b1a1-167c7dd28c6e', 'd2f8e72e-ddb8-4750-a861-7508e5a402af', 'd33c0cc9-37e3-4091-b4b7-4a047bfceeb0', 'd56ed0eb-d0a7-4295-aeeb-b6fa02144a65', 'd627edfd-46cd-4611-b313-c1fa209e380b', 'da32b98b-fef5-4f54-a627-18761f37c8a3', 'e2073e32-2877-42e0-8c24-33e4270f0f83', 'ed8222fd-bf46-4ee1-b0de-a05fb9ab3f63', 'f022c47f-3d63-488f-b4ab-4b7465d5b685', 'f0e9b5a8-3282-4570-8d20-5941e8334010', 'f78ecfcf-bc34-4aaa-b40c-7ce650e20d85', 'fb209bd6-4a6a-4eb0-aa46-40e99daf3e30']",MoRePriv: mobile OS support for application personalization and privacy,annual computer security applications conference,2014,4b0336d7-e168-45cd-88b1-5f2ab3ac72bb
"Deregistration due to the departures of mobile users from their current visiting registration area may cause significant traffic in the wireless cellular networks. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical implicit deregistration scheme with forced registration in third-generation wireless cellular networks to reduce the remote/international roaming signaling traffic when home-location registers (HLRs), gateway-location registers (GLRs), and the visitor-location registers (VLRs) form a three-level database hierarchy. In this scheme, if a mobile phone arrives and the GLR/VLR is full, a random record is deleted and the reclaimed storage is reassigned to the new arriving mobile phone. When a call arrives and the callee's record is missing in the GLR/VLR, forced registration is executed to restore the GLR/VLR record before the call-setup operation proceeds. An analytic model is proposed to carry out the performance evaluation for the proposed scheme. Our results show that the proposed scheme not only reduces the local deregistration traffic between the GLR and the VLR, but also reduces the remote/international deregistration traffic between the HLR and the GLR, especially when the ratio of the cost of the remote/international traffic between GLR and HLR to the cost of local traffic between the VLR and the GLR is high.","['Yang Xiao', 'Yuguang Fang', 'Yi-Bing Lin']",9,['02707f4d-93b0-4bc3-8e62-c4ce9d29e1c5'],Hierarchical implicit deregistration with forced registrations in 3G wireless networks,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2004,4b034600-8624-467b-b1a5-3c873bfb9207

The presented method constitutes the first guaranteed globally optimal estimator for both components of the problem with respect to a cost function based on reprojection errors.

"In a recent study, Cardinali et al. (2009) showed that training the use of a tool affected kinematic characteristics of subsequent free movements (i.e., movement were slower, for instance), which they interpreted as that the use of a tool affects the body schema. The current study examined whether these results can also be explained in terms of motor learning where movement characteristics during tool use persist in the free movements. Using a different tool we replicated parts of the study of Cardinali et al: As did Cardinali et al. we found that tool use after-effects can be found in subsequent free movements. Importantly, we showed that the tooling movement was very slow compared to the free hand movement. We concluded that it can not be ruled out yet that after-effects of tool use originate from a general slowing down of movement speed that persists in free hand movements.",['Raoul M.

The competitive advantages achieved by data mining include increased revenue, reduced cost, and much improved marketplace responsiveness and awareness. There has been a large body of research and practice focusing on exploring data mining techniques to solve financial problems. In this paper, we describe data mining in the context of financial application from both technical and application perspectives. In addition, we compare different data mining techniques and discuss important data mining issues involved in specific financial applications.

"Side channel attacks and more specifically fault, simple power attacks, constitute a pragmatic, potent mean of braking a cryptographic algorithm like RSA. For this reason, many researchers have proposed modifications on the arithmetic operation functions required for RSA in order to thwart those attacks. However, these modifications are applied on theoretic — algorithmic level and do not necessary result in high performance RSA designs. This paper constitute the first complete attempt for an efficient design approach on a fault and simple power attack resistant RSA based on the well known, for its high performance, Montgomery multiplication algorithm. To achieve this, a fault and simple power attack resistant modular exponentiation algorithm is proposed that is based on the Montgomery modular multiplication. In order to optimize this algorithm's performance we also propose a modified version of Montgomery modular multiplication algorithm that employs value precomputation and carry save logic in all input, output and intermediate values. We introduce a hardware architecture based on the proposed Montgomery modular multiplication algorithm and use it as a building block for the design of a fault and simple power attack resistant modular exponentiation unit. This unit is optimized by taking advantage of the inherit parallelism in the proposed fault and simple power attack resistant modular exponentiation algorithm. Realizing the proposed unit in FPGA technology very advantageous results are found when compared against other well known designs even though our design bears an extra computation cost due to its fault and simple power attack resistance characteristic.",['Apostolos P.

"We present an algorithm developed for GIS-applications in order to produce maps of landside susceptibility in postglacial and glacial sediments in Sweden. The algorithm operates on detailed topographic and Quaternary deposit data. We compare our algorithm to two similar computational schemes based on a global visibility operator and a shadow-casting algorithm. We find that our algorithm produces more reliable results in the vicinity of stable material than the global visibility algorithm. We also conclude that our algorithm is more computationally efficient than the other two methods, which is important when we may want to assess the effects of uncertainty in the data by evaluating many different models. Our method also provides the possibility to take other data into account. We show how different soil types with different geotechnical properties may be modelled. Our algorithm may also take depth information, i.e. the thicknesses of the deposits into account. We thus propose that our method may be used to provide more refined maps than the overview maps in areas where more detailed geotechnical/geological data have been acquired. The efficiency of our algorithm suggests that it may replace any global visibility operators used in other applications or processing schemes of gridded map data.","['Ari Tryggvason', 'Caterina Melchiorre', 'Kerstin Johansson']",0,[],A fast and efficient algorithm to map prerequisites of landslides in sensitive clays based on detailed soil and topographical information,Computers & Geosciences,2015,4b03b7f7-d6f8-4fe2-b790-21c87f70b290
"The introduction of enterprise identity management systems (EldMS) in organisations is a costly and challenging endeavour, where organisations have to face various costs for the planning, the implementation, and the operation of such systems. In the planning phase it is important that organisational aspects are incorporated into the development of an enterprise identity management (EldM) solution, instead of purely focussing on the technological or financial issues. Indeed, without a proper assessment of the costs and the organisational settings (such as stakeholders, processes), companies will not see the benefit for introducing EldM as additional layer into their IT infrastructure and their business processes. This paper proposes initial ideas for a generic approach, based on the balanced scorecard, for assessing the value of investing in the introduction of EldMS.

"This paper proposes and evaluates a new approach to directory-based cache coherence protocols called  Reactive NUMA  (R-NUMA). An R-NUMA system combines a conventional CC-NUMA coherence protocol with a more-recent Simple-COMA (S-COMA) protocol. What makes R-NUMA novel is the way it dynamically reacts to program and system behavior to switch between CC-NUMA and S-COMA and exploit the best aspects of both protocols. This reactive behavior allows each node in an R-NUMA system to independently choose the best protocol for a particular page, thus providing much greater performance stability than either CC-NUMA or S-COMA alone. Our evaluation is both qualitative and quantitative. We first show the theoretical result that R-NUMA's worst-case performance is bounded within a small constant factor (i.e., two to three times) of the best of CC-NUMA and S-COMA. We then use detailed execution-driven simulation to show that, in practice, R-NUMA usually performs better than either a pure CC-NUMA or pure S-COMA protocol, and no more than 57% worse than the best of CC-NUMA and S-COMA, for our benchmarks and base system assumptions.","['Babak Falsafi', 'David A.

"This paper is concerned with the problem of exponential stability for a class of Markovian jump impulsive stochastic Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with mixed time delays and known or unknown parameters. The jumping parameters are determined by a continuous-time, discrete-state Markov chain, and the mixed time delays under consideration comprise both time-varying delays and continuously distributed delays. To the best of the authors' knowledge, till now, the exponential stability problem for this class of generalized neural networks has not yet been solved since continuously distributed delays are considered in this paper. The main objective of this paper is to fill this gap. By constructing a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, and using some new approaches and techniques, several novel sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure the exponential stability of the trivial solution in the mean square. The results presented in this paper generalize and improve many known results. Finally, two numerical examples and their simulations are given to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.","['Quanxin Zhu', 'Jinde Cao']",265,"['3a47e6a5-37f2-4377-b87f-c61d1a27c81d', '424b1aac-673c-4d8d-a459-903e4cbb5444', '6c199982-68f3-4a3a-9619-901f76d958f6', '6c58fbf4-8b26-435a-bfe5-5369810f12cd', '9303c2f5-9b4f-40a2-97dc-10f11eb4dd25', '98541f56-ad91-4a7c-9347-462f37c95502', '99261026-89cf-4a22-b32d-126eb1fc9f29', 'bf5205ea-ff18-458b-b0fe-3cd7265584db', 'c8ece721-1152-4cef-9a8a-cf51eed70539', 'dd3e8ac8-ab70-4f73-b677-af880d07d696', 'e15e2942-a280-410d-8c35-c105be77164d', 'e9f80741-8320-42b0-a724-b24816e71961']",Robust Exponential Stability of Markovian Jump Impulsive Stochastic Cohen-Grossberg Neural Networks With Mixed Time Delays,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks,2010,4b03f877-7029-4ae5-9180-109216bb20d3
"The type and effect discipline, a framework for reconstructing the principal type and the minimal effect of expressions in implicitly typed polymorphic functional languages that support imperative constructs, is introduced. The type and effect discipline outperforms other polymorphic type systems. Just as types abstract collections of concrete values, effects denote imperative operations on regions. Regions abstract sets of possibly aliased memory locations. Effects are used to control type generalization in the presence of imperative constructs while regions delimit observable side effects. The observable effects of an expression range over the regions that are free in its type environment and its type; effects related to local data structures can be discarded during type reconstruction. The type of an expression can be generalized with respect to the variables that are not free in the type environment or in the observable effect. >","['Jean-Pierre Talpin', 'Pierre Jouvelot']",406,"['0ec77e45-0460-40b1-a9ac-6226f9c75609', '112eeff7-c265-4808-aef5-55f592540e40', '23c82e3b-76e3-401a-835b-7b7cc9e708c0', '308b7e64-9723-4d81-8521-14399fbce742', '42ae9b39-59f6-4bf7-804c-6310a5b68024', '68710711-e569-4b5f-a2df-7dbea65d97d3', 'a02cb3c9-080b-4966-988e-760d9fbbb4d0', 'bf3187b7-6952-4ff0-9ed5-ac79a41dbdf0', 'e1b57977-9f7e-4c38-8bae-888421b42c5a', 'e8f4ba19-34fa-4d5f-9a41-7ed72abbf14d', 'edb7a8e6-909c-42eb-9a92-b3653fbefa83']",The type and effect discipline,logic in computer science,1992,4b040b0e-0ab9-4a15-9569-a5c416f86cd4
"This paper presents a new acoustic-to-articulatory inversion method-based on an episodic memory, which is an interesting model for two reasons. First, it does not rely on any assumptions about the mapping function but rather it relies on real synchronized acoustic and articulatory data streams. Second, the memory structurally embeds the naturalness of the articulatory dynamics. In addition, we introduce the concept of generative episodic memory, which enables the production of unseen articulatory trajectories according to the acoustic signals to be inverted. The proposed memory is evaluated on the MOCHA corpus. The results show its effectiveness and are very encouraging since they are comparable to those of recently proposed methods.","['Sébastien Demange', 'Slim Ouni']",3,"['2100f431-8f6c-453f-bf80-30cae4b2ebf5', '258b0cfe-154f-437b-988a-7d82b760abf3', '26d37393-6e59-4423-a935-860b5a76f1f6', '798ada33-3e6b-46dd-85f3-77de846c66dc', '8a405d3e-d942-41bc-8be5-81b55b565330', '9fe03135-f031-4834-8dd8-a41cca080a5c', 'd8c36c8d-f555-4fc1-8b6a-4cf6d7d81642', 'db227dbb-3a0f-4d7a-bbcc-f2132b2c8209']",Acoustic-to-articulatory inversion using an episodic memory,"international conference on acoustics, speech, and signal processing",2011,4b040d6a-872b-4bec-bc9d-24902d0f08c1

"An infrared sensor is modeled and analyzed in Uppaal. The sensor typifies the sort of component that engineers regularly integrate into larger systems by writing interface hardware and software.   In all, three main models are developed. In the first model, the timing diagram of the sensor is interpreted and modeled as a timed safety automaton. This model serves as a specification for the complete system. A second model that emphasizes the separate roles of driver and sensor is then developed. It is validated against the timing diagram model using an existing construction that permits the verification of timed trace inclusion, for certain models, by reachability analysis (i.e., model checking). A transmission correctness property is also stated by means of an auxiliary automaton and shown to be satisfied by the model.   A third model is created from an assembly language driver program, using a direct translation from the instruction set of a processor with simple timing behavior. This model is validated against the driver component of the second timing diagram model using the timed trace inclusion validation technique. The approach and its limitations offer insight into the nature and challenges of programming in real time.","['Timothy Bourke', 'Arcot Sowmya']",3,"['48978913-7441-4636-8352-75a7bc484d23', '667d31cf-ee82-40f0-bbe6-8c3a88f9b4e0', '6d9fe0df-f58b-43cf-87b4-b77a45afc235', '756b4570-813b-486f-b38a-b55b050065e7', '94d77b72-633e-45c3-991a-6343c4a22d22', 'c1102d81-fb2c-4701-94c6-47feea928648', 'd3659d15-174d-4923-8e72-0a405b8ff954', 'f715f6db-eabe-43e6-836a-4116ab1139d1']",Analyzing an embedded sensor with timed automata in uppaal,ACM Transactions in Embedded Computing Systems,2013,4b045ff7-40d5-4a8f-920d-b88c388c30d0

"Motivation: This paper presents a global test to be used for the analysis of microarray data. Using this test it can be determined whether the global expression pattern of a group of genes is significantly related to some clinical outcome of interest. Groups of genes may be any size from a single gene to all genes on the chip (e.g. known pathways, specific areas of the genome or clusters from a cluster analysis).#R##N##R##N#Result: The test allows groups of genes of different size to be compared, because the test gives one p-value for the group, not a p-value for each gene. Researchers can use the test to investigate hypotheses based on theory or past research or to mine gene ontology databases for interesting pathways. Multiple testing problems do not occur unless many groups are tested. Special attention is given to visualizations of the test result, focussing on the associations between samples and showing the impact of individual genes on the test result.#R##N##R##N#Availability: An R-package globaltest is available from http://www.bioconductor.org","['Jelle J.

"Information Security Governance has become one of the key focus areas of strategic management due to its importance in the overall protection of the organization's information assets. A properly implemented Information Security Governance framework should ideally facilitate the implementation of (directing), and compliance to (control), Strategic level management directives. These Strategic level management directives are normally interpreted, disseminated and implemented by means of a series of information security related policies. These policies should ideally be disseminated and implemented from the Strategic management level, through the Tactical level to the Operational level where eventual execution takes place. Control is normally exercised by capturing data at the lowest levels of execution and measuring compliance against the Operational level policies. Through statistical and summarized analyses of the Operational level data into higher levels of extraction, compliance at the Tactical and Strategic levels can be facilitated. This scenario of directing and controlling defines the basis of sound Information Security Governance. Unfortunately, information security policies are normally not disseminated onto the Operational level. As a result, proper controlling is difficult and therefore compliance measurement against all information security policies might be problematic. The objective of this paper is to argue towards a more complete information security policy architecture that will facilitate complete control, and therefore compliance, to ensure sound Information Security Governance.","['Rossouw von Solms', 'Kerry-Lynn Thomson', 'Prosecutor Mvikeli Maninjwa']",50,"['022edf57-ff31-4ec2-9c9b-cf8ef9f4f486', '062fd2be-2376-45f2-a324-13885c0fd973', '08b536d1-beb5-488b-980e-5fc034241497', '1c306d07-b819-4200-99fd-11895806f644', '1e224c66-91bf-4ab7-be9c-7f4ed39214e8', '407fa854-36f0-4fef-b41f-0f5337ed3435', '683d193d-52ba-4eb2-a7a0-78bd0c5953cd', '9b45c809-baec-4f83-8e75-40a9f4d6ed29', '9bf43ad8-0088-465d-9bc5-5a629e8e0849', '9dd86d02-071b-4e2d-bc37-bf68cd1da98c', 'a6164231-5947-48d8-9081-681d8cd85720', 'b296f674-2843-481c-8c2b-e168b06e3e33', 'd28cbaaf-d4b0-47a2-b0ff-ec452cbb0963', 'e93b8b48-eb67-4fba-b990-9cd151925598', 'f12b4ac7-2cfb-4c8a-8b59-8c53971afd78']",Information Security Governance control through comprehensive policy architectures,information security for south africa,2011,4b049055-1179-468e-b932-f431b1b98108
"The Internet is rapidly changing from a set of wires and switches that carry packets into a sophisticated infrastructure that delivers a set of complex value-added services to end users. Services can range from bit transport all the way up to distributed value-added services like video teleconferencing, data mining, and distributed interactive simulations. Before such services can be supported in a general and dynamic manner we have to develop appropriate resource management mechanisms. These resource management mechanisms must make it possible to identify and allocate resources that meet service or application requirements, support both isolation and controlled dynamic sharing of resources across organizations sharing physical resources, and be customizable so services and applications can tailor resource usage to optimize their performance. The Darwin project is developing a set of customizable resource management mechanisms that support value-added services, In this paper we present these mechanisms, describe their implementation in a prototype system, and describe the results of a series of proof-of-concept experiments.","['Prashant R.

"Support vector ordinal regression (SVOR) is a recently proposed ordinal regression (OR) algorithm. Despite its theoretical and empirical success, the method has one major bottleneck, which is the high computational complexity. In this brief, we propose a both practical and theoretical guaranteed algorithm, block-quantized support vector ordinal regression (BQSVOR), where we approximate the kernel matrix  K  with [( K )\tilde] that is composed of  k   2  constant blocks. We provide detailed theoretical justification on the approximation accuracy of BQSVOR. Moreover, we prove theoretically that the OR problem with the block-quantized kernel matrix [( K )\tilde] could be solved by first separating the data samples in the training set into  k  clusters with kernel  k -means and then performing SVOR on the  k  cluster representatives. Hence, the algorithm leads to an optimization problem that scales only with the number of clusters, instead of the data set size. Finally, experiments on several real-world data sets support the previous analysis and demonstrate that BQSVOR improves the speed of SVOR significantly with guaranteed accuracy.","['Bin Zhao', 'Fei Wang', 'Changshui Zhang']",50,"['030ff229-c6c1-4600-9580-fa0c98b77e90', '21bec80d-3f7c-4a6b-b95f-9d207847b4c4', '2c4c35f1-3777-4606-b5d2-3a8383ab0df9', '3f35d450-abdd-4cc4-bddb-8ae8c40bcc65', '4299e3db-c1dd-486a-9ff2-7f5b5f8aa402', '474b821f-b42f-4c4a-9169-66ebdcf3e4f8', '4c6debfe-e06c-4372-903e-ae3c9ff98791', '5f28c1ad-a812-4b27-80c5-93349b42ef58', '86b69247-af69-4276-a105-b5e821559946', '8bfb1563-5f31-4127-a98c-8d36c630fce8', '9ccf049f-b60f-46f5-a592-464a0b505bfd', 'a3dfcf4c-b20d-4fa0-9e8d-38ce2da71685', 'ca86ab70-0f5d-4e99-8b7e-0646613dcb4f', 'd352ac12-0128-4fa0-9817-f4e4cc2b9c34', 'da3296b0-77a9-49ea-98db-8f5ced87a814', 'dad07d3b-7393-4ce0-a74e-aa0f4b541564', 'e4c21fc2-333e-4c61-bfde-15b0537cff3f', 'ee292642-4cf7-4c76-9f0b-20e0c5a11dac']",Block-Quantized Support Vector Ordinal Regression,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks,2009,4b04cd84-f8f9-4ac2-b542-cae8d4ee5213

"Moreover, in order to have a physical interpretation, some constraints should be incorporated in the signal or image processing technique, such as the non-negativity of the solution. This paper deals with the non-negative pre-image problem in kernel machines, for nonlinear pattern recognition. While kernel machines operate in a feature space, associated to the used kernel function, a pre-image technique is often required to map back features into the input space. We derive a gradient-based algorithm to solve the pre-image problem, and to guarantee the non-negativity of the solution. Its convergence speed is significantly improved due to a weighted stepsize approach.

Hardware cost is reduced under the assumption that synchronization during acquisition does not have to be very accurate, but sufficient for coarse estimation. The architecture is synthesized towards a 65nm low-leakage high threshold standard cell CMOS library. The proposed architecture results in area reduction of 93% if compared to typical 8-bit implementation. The area occupied by the architecture is 0.063 mm 2 .
